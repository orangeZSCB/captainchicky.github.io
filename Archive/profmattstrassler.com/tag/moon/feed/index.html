										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 1999 I saw a total solar eclipse in Europe, and it was a life-altering experience.  I wrote about it back then, but was never entirely happy with the article.  This week I&#8217;ve revised it.  It could still benefit from some editing and revision (comments welcome), but I think it&#8217;s now a good read.  It&#8217;s full of intellectual observations, but there are powerful emotions too.</p>

<p><strong> A Luminescent Darkness: My 1999 Eclipse Adventure</strong></p>
<p>© Matt Strassler 1999</p>
<p>After two years of dreaming, two months of planning, and two hours of packing, I drove to John F. Kennedy airport, took the shuttle to the Air France terminal, and checked in.  I was brimming with excitement. In three days time, with a bit of luck, I would witness one the great spectacles that a human being can experience: a complete, utter and total eclipse of the Sun.<span id="more-9609"></span></p>
<p>I had missed one eight years earlier. In July 1991, a total solar eclipse crossed over Baja California. I had thought seriously about driving the fourteen hundred miles from the San Francisco area, where I was a graduate student studying theoretical physics, to the very southern tip of the peninsula. But worried about my car&#8217;s ill health and scared by rumors of gasoline shortages in Baja, I chickened out. Four of my older colleagues, more worldly and more experienced, and supplied with a more reliable vehicle, drove down together. When they returned, exhilarated, they regaled us with stories of their magical adventure. Hearing their tales, I kicked myself for not going, and had been kicking myself ever since. Life is not so long that such opportunities can be rationalized or procrastinated away.</p>
<p>A total eclipse of the Sun is a event of mythic significance, so rare and extraordinary and unbelievable that it really ought to exist only in ancient legends, in epic poems, and in science fiction stories. There are other types of eclipses &#8212; partial and total eclipses of the Moon, in which the Earth blocks sunlight that normally illuminates the Moon, and various eclipses of the Sun in which the Moon blocks sunlight that normally illuminates the Earth. But total solar eclipses are in a class all their own. Only during the brief moments of totality does the Sun vanish altogether, leaving the shocked spectator in a suddenly darkened world, gazing uncomprehendingly at a black disk of nothingness.</p>
<p>Our species relies on daylight. Day is warm; day grows our food; day permits travel with a clear sense of what lies ahead. We are so fearful of the night &#8212; of what lurks there unseen, of the sounds that we cannot interpret. Horror films rely on this fear; demons and axe murderers are rarely found walking about in bright sunshine. Dark places are dangerous places; sudden unexpected darkness is worst of all. These are the conventions of cinema, born of our inmost psychology. But the Sun and the Moon are not actors projected on a screen. The terror is real.</p>
<p>It has been said that if the Earth were a member of a federation of a million planets, it would be a famous tourist attraction, because this home of ours would be the only one in the republic with such beautiful eclipses. For our skies are witness to a coincidence truly of cosmic proportions. It is a stunning accident that although the Sun is so immense that it could hold a million Earths, and the Moon so small that dozens could fit inside our planet, these two spheres, the brightest bodies in Earth&#8217;s skies, appear the same size. A faraway giant may seem no larger than a nearby child. And this perfect match of their sizes and distances makes our planet&#8217;s eclipses truly spectacular, visually and scientifically. They are described by witnesses as a sight of weird and unique beauty, a visual treasure completely unlike anything else a person will ever see, or even imagine.</p>
<p>But total solar eclipses are uncommon, occurring only once every year or two. Even worse, totality only occurs in a narrow band that sweeps across the Earth &#8212; often just across its oceans. Only a small fraction of the Earth sees a total eclipse in any century. And so these eclipses are precious; only the lucky, or the devoted, will experience one before they die.</p>
<p>In my own life, I&#8217;d certainly been more devoted than lucky. I knew it wasn&#8217;t wise to wait for the Moon&#8217;s shadow to find me by chance. Instead I was going on a journey to place myself in its path.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in eclipse-chasing is the logistics. The area in which totality is visible is very long but very narrow. For my trip, in 1999, it was a long strip running west to east all across Europe, but only a hundred miles wide from north to south. A narrow zone crossing heavily populated areas is sure to attract a massive crowd, so finding hotels and transport can be difficult. Furthermore, although eclipses are precisely predictable, governed by the laws of gravity worked out by Isaac Newton himself, weather and human beings are far less dependable.</p>
<p>But I had a well-considered plan. I would travel by train to a small city east of Paris, where I had reserved a rental car. Keeping a close watch on the weather forecast, I would drive on back roads, avoiding clogged highways. I had no hotel reservations. It would have been pointless to make them for the night before the event, since it was well known that everything within two hours drive of the totality zone was booked solid. Moreover, I wanted the flexibility to adjust to the weather and couldn&#8217;t know in advance where I&#8217;d want to stay. So my idea was that on the night prior to the eclipse, I would drive to a good location in the path of the lunar shadow, and sleep in the back of my car. I had a sleeping bag with me to keep me warm, and enough lightweight clothing for the week &#8212; and not much else.</p>
<p>Oh, it was such a good plan, clean and simple, and that&#8217;s why my heart had so far to sink and my brain so ludicrous a calamity to contemplate when I checked my wallet, an hour before flight time, and saw a gaping black emptiness where my driver&#8217;s license was supposed to be. I was struck dumb. No license meant no car rental; no car meant no flexibility and no place to sleep. Sixteen years of driving and I had never lost it before; why, why, of all times, now, when it was to play a central role in a once-in-a-lifetime adventure?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t panic. I walked calmly back to the check-in counters, managed to get myself rescheduled for a flight on the following day, drove the three hours back to New Jersey, and started looking. It wasn&#8217;t in my car. Nor was it in the pile of unneeded items I&#8217;d removed from my wallet. Not in my suitcase, not under my bed, not in my office. As it was Sunday, I couldn&#8217;t get a replacement license. Hope dimmed, flickered, and went dark.</p>
<p>Deep breaths. Plan B?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have a tent, and couldn&#8217;t easily have found one. But I did have a rain poncho, large enough to keep my sleeping bag off the ground. As long as it didn&#8217;t rain too hard, I could try, the night before the eclipse, to find a place to camp outdoors; with luck I&#8217;d find lodging for the other nights. I doubted this would be legal, but I was willing to take the chance. But what about my suitcase? I couldn&#8217;t carry that around with me into the wilderness. Fortunately, I knew a solution. For a year after college, I had studied music in France, and had often gone sightseeing by rail. On those trips I had commonly made use of the ubiquitous lockers at the train stations, leaving some luggage while I explored the nearby town. As for flexibility of location, that was unrecoverable; the big downside of Plan B was that I could no longer adjust to the weather. I&#8217;d just have to be lucky. I comforted myself with the thought that the worst that could happen to me would be a week of eating French food.</p>
<p>So the next day, carrying the additional weight of a poncho and an umbrella, but having in compensation discarded all inessential clothing and tourist information, I headed back to the airport, this time by bus. Without further misadventures, I was soon being carried across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>As usual I struggled to nap amid the loud silence of a night flight. But my sleeplessness was rewarded with one of those good omens that makes you think that you must be doing the right thing. As we approached the European coastline, and I gazed sleepily out my window, I suddenly saw a bright glowing light. It was the rising white tip of the thin crescent Moon.</p>
<p>Solar eclipses occur at New Moon, always. This is nothing but simple geometry; the Moon must place itself exactly between the Sun and the Earth to cause an eclipse, and that means the half of the Moon that faces us must be in shadow. (At Full Moon, the opposite is true; the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, so the half of the Moon that faces us is in full sunlight. That&#8217;s when lunar eclipses can occur.) And just before a New Moon, the Moon is close to the Sun&#8217;s location in the sky. It becomes visible, as the Earth turns, just before the Sun does, rising as a morning crescent shortly before sunrise. (Similarly, we get an evening crescent just after a New Moon.)</p>
<p>There, out over the vast Atlantic, from a dark ocean of water into a dark sea of stars, rose the delicate thin slip of Luna the lover, on her way to her mystical rendezvous with Sol. Her crescent smiled at me and winked a greeting. I smiled back, and whispered, &#8220;see you in two days&#8230;&#8221; For totality is not merely the only time you can look straight at the Sun and see its crown. It is the only time you can see the New Moon.</p>
<p>We landed in Paris at 6:30 Monday morning, E-day-minus-two. I headed straight to the airport train station, and poured over rail maps and my road maps trying to guess a good location to use as a base. Eventually I chose a medium-sized town with the name Charleville-Mezieres. It was on the northern edge of the totality zone, at the end of a large spoke of the Paris-centered rail system, and was far enough from Paris, Brussels, and all large German towns that I suspected it might escape the worst of the crowds. It would then be easy, the night before the eclipse, to take a train back into the center of the zone, where totality would last the longest.</p>
<p>Two hours later I was in the Paris-East rail station and had purchased my ticket for Charleville-Mezieres. With ninety minutes to wait, I wandered around the station. It was evident that France had gone eclipse-happy. Every magazine had a cover story; every newspaper had a special insert; signs concerning the event were everywhere. Many of the magazines carried free eclipse glasses, with a black opaque metallic material for lenses that only the Sun can penetrate. Warnings against looking at the Sun without them were to be found on every newspaper front page. I soon learned that there had been a dreadful scandal in which a widely distributed shipment of imported glasses was discovered to be dangerously defective, leading the government to make a hurried and desperate attempt to recall them. There were also many leaflets advertising planned events in towns lying in the totality zone, and information about extra trains that would be running. A chaotic rush out of Paris was clearly expected.</p>
<p>Before noon I was on a train heading through the Paris suburbs into the farmlands of the Champagne region. The rocking of the train put me right to sleep, but the shrieking children halfway up the rail car quickly ended my nap. I watched the lovely sunlit French countryside as it rolled by. The Sun was by now well overhead &#8212; or rather, the Earth had rotated so that France was nearly facing the Sun head on. Sometimes, when the train banked on a turn, the light nearly blinded me, and I had to close my eyes.</p>
<p>With my eyelids shut, I thought about how I&#8217;d managed, over decades, to avoid ever once accidentally staring at the Sun for even a second&#8230; and about how almost every animal with eyes manages to do this during its entire life. It&#8217;s quite a feat, when you think about it. But it&#8217;s essential, of course. The Sun&#8217;s ferocious blaze is even worse than it appears, for it contains more than just visible light. It also radiates light too violet for us to see &#8212; ultraviolet &#8212; which is powerful enough to destroy our vision. Any animal lacking instincts powerful enough to keep its eyes off the Sun will go blind, soon to starve or be eaten. But humans are in danger during solar eclipses, because our intense curiosity can make us ignore our instincts. Many of us will suffer permanent eye damage, not understanding when and how it is safe to look at the Sun&#8230; which is almost, but not quite, never.</p>
<p>In fact the only time it is safe to look with the naked eye is during totality, when the Sun&#8217;s disk is completely blocked by the New Moon, and the world is dark. Then, and only then, can one see that the Sun is not a sphere, and that it has a sort of atmosphere, immense and usually unseen.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Sun, and source of its awesome power, is its nuclear furnace, nearly thirty million degrees hot and nearly five billion years old. All that heat gradually filters and boils out of the Sun&#8217;s core toward its visible surface, which is a mere six thousand degrees&#8230; still white-hot. Outside this region is a large irregular halo of material that is normally too dim to see against the blinding disk. The inner part of that halo is called the chromosphere; there, giant eruptions called &#8220;prominences&#8221; loop outward into space. The outer part of the halo is the &#8220;corona&#8221;, Latin for &#8220;crown.&#8221; The opportunity to see the Sun&#8217;s corona is one of the main reasons to seek totality.</p>
<p>Still very drowsy, but in a good mood, I arrived in Charleville. Wanting to leave my bags in the station while I looked for a hotel room, I searched for the luggage lockers. After three tiring trips around the station, I asked at a ticket booth. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the woman behind the desk, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t had them available since the Algerian terrorism of a few years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gulped. This threatened plan B, for what was I to do with my luggage on eclipse day? I certainly couldn&#8217;t walk out into the French countryside looking for a place to camp while carrying a full suitcase and a sleeping bag! And even the present problem of looking for a hotel would be daunting. The woman behind the desk was sympathetic, but her only suggestion was to try one of the hotels near the station. Since the tourist information office was a mile away, it seemed the only good option, and I lugged my bags across the street.</p>
<p>Here, finally, luck smiled. The very first place I stopped at had a room for that night, reasonably priced and perfectly clean, if spartan. It was also available the night after the eclipse. My choice of Charleville had been wise. Unfortunately, even here, Eclipse Eve &#8212; Tuesday evening &#8212; was as bad as I imagined. The hoteliere assured me that all of Charleville was booked (and my later attempts to find a room, even a last-minute cancellation, proved fruitless.) Still, she she was happy for me to leave my luggage at the hotel while I tramped through the French countryside. Thus was Plan B saved.</p>
<p>Somewhat relieved, I wandered around the town. Charleville is not unattractive, and the orange sandstone 16th century architecture of its central square is very pleasing to the eye. By dusk I was exhausted and collapsed on my bed. I slept long and deep, and awoke refreshed. I took a short sightseeing trip by train, ate a delicious lunch, and tried one more time to find a room in Charleville for Eclipse Eve. Failing once again, I resolved to camp in the heart of the totality zone.</p>
<p>But where? I had several criteria in mind. For the eclipse, I wanted to be far from any large town or highway, so that streetlights, often automatically triggered by darkness, would not spoil the experience. Also I wanted hills and farmland; I wanted to be at a summit, with no trees nearby, in order to have the best possible view. It didn&#8217;t take long to decide on a location. About five miles south of the unassuming town of Rethel, rebuilt after total destruction in the first world war, my map showed a high hill. It seemed perfect.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I learned just in time that this same high hill had attracted the attention of the local authorities, and they had decided to designate this very place the &#8220;official viewing site&#8221; in the region. A hundred thousand people were expected to descend on Rethel and take shuttles from the town to the &#8220;site.&#8221; Clearly this was not where I wanted to be!</p>
<p>So instead, when I arrived in Rethel, I walked in another direction. I aimed for an area a few miles west of town, quiet hilly farmland.</p>
<p>Yet again, my luck seemed to be on the wane. By four it was drizzling, and by five it was raining. Darkness would settle at around eight, and I had little time to find a site for unobtrusive camping, much less a dry one. The rain stopped, restarted, hesitated, spat, but refused to go away. An unending mass of rain clouds could be seen heading toward me from the west. I had hoped to use trees for some shelter against rain, but now the trees were drenched and dripping, even worse than the rain itself.</p>
<p>Still completely unsure what I would do, I continued walking into the evening. I must have cut a very odd figure, carrying an open umbrella, a sleeping bag, and a small black backpack. I took a break in a village square, taking shelter at a church&#8217;s side door, where I munched on French bread and cheese. Maybe one of these farmers would let me sleep in a dry spot in his barn, I thought to myself. But I still hadn&#8217;t reached the hills I was aiming for, so I kept walking.</p>
<p>After another mile, I came to a hilltop with a dirt farm track crossing the road. There, just off the road to the right, was a large piece of farm machinery. And underneath it, a large, flat, sheltered spot. Hideous, but I could sleep there. Since it wasn&#8217;t quite nightfall yet and I could see a hill on the other side of the road along the same track, one which looked like it might be good for watching the eclipse, I took a few minutes to explore it. There I found another piece of farm equipment, also with a sheltered underbelly. This one was much further from the road, looked unused, and presumably offered both safer and quieter shelter. It was sitting just off the dirt track in a fallow field. The field was of thick, sticky, almost hard mud, the kind you don&#8217;t slip in and which doesn&#8217;t ooze but which gloms onto the sides of your shoe.</p>
<p>And so it was that Eclipse Eve found me spreading my poncho in a friendly unknown farmer&#8217;s field, twisting my body so as not to hit my head on the metal bars of my shelter, carefully unwrapping my sleeping bag and removing my shoes so as not to cover everything in mud, brushing my teeth in bottled water, and bedding down for the night. The whole scene was so absurd that I found myself sporting a slightly manic grin and giggling. But still, I was satisfied. Despite the odds, I was in the zone at the appointed time; when I awoke the next morning I would be scarcely two miles from my final destination. If the clouds were against me, so be it. I had done my part.</p>
<p>I slept pretty well, considering both my excitement and the uneven ground. At daybreak I was surrounded by fog, but by 8 a.m.~the fog was lifting, revealing a few spots of blue sky amid low clouds. My choice of shelter was also confirmed; my sleeping bag was dry, and across the road the other piece of machinery I had considered was already in use.</p>
<p>I packed up and started walking west again. The weather seemed uncertain, with three layers of clouds &#8212; low stratus, medium cumulus, and high cirrus &#8212; crossing over each other. Blue patches would appear, then close up. I trudged to the base of my chosen hill, then followed another dirt track to the top, where I was graced with a lovely view. The rolling <em>paysage</em> of fertile France stretched before me, blotched here and there with sunshine.  Again I had chosen well, better than I realized, as it turned out, for I was not alone on the hill. A Belgian couple had chosen it too &#8212; and they had a car&#8230;</p>
<p>There I waited. The minutes ticked by. The temperature fluctuated, and the fields changed color, as the Sun played hide and seek. I didn&#8217;t need these reminders of the Sun&#8217;s importance &#8212; that without its heat the Earth would freeze, and without its light, plants would not grow and the cycle of life would quickly end. I thought about how pre-scientific cultures had viewed the Sun. In cultures and religions around the world, the blazing disk has often been attributed divine power and regal authority. And why not? In the past century, we&#8217;ve finally learned what the Sun is made from and why it shines. But we are no less in awe than our ancestors, for the Sun is much larger, much older, and much more powerful than most of them imagined.</p>
<p>For a while, I listened to the radio. Crowds were assembling across Europe. Special events &#8212; concerts, art shows, contests &#8212; were taking place, organized by towns in the zone to coincide with the eclipse. This was hardly surprising. All those tourists had come for totality. But totality is brief, never more than a handful of minutes.  It&#8217;s the luck of geometry, the details of the orbits of the Earth and Moon, that set its duration. For my eclipse, the Moon&#8217;s shadow was only about a hundred miles wide. Racing along at three thousand miles per hour, it would darken any one location for at most two minutes. Now if a million people are expected to descend on your town for a two-minute event, I suppose it is a good idea to give them something else to do while they wait. And of course, the French cultural establishment loves this kind of opportunity. Multimedia events are their specialty, and they often give commissions to contemporary artists. I was particularly amused to discover later that an old acquaintance of mine &#8212; I met him in 1987 at the composers&#8217; entrance exams for the Paris Conservatory &#8212; had been commissioned to write an orchestral piece, called &#8220;Eclipse,&#8221; for the festival in the large city of Reims. It was performed just before the moment of darkness.</p>
<p>Finally, around 11:30, the eclipse began. The Moon nibbled a tiny notch out of the sun. I looked at it briefly through my eclipse glasses, and felt the first butterflies of anticipation. The Belgian couple, in their late fourties, came up to the top of the hill and stood alongside me. They were Flemish, but the man spoke French, and we chatted for a while. It turned out he was a scientist also, and had spent some time in the United States, so we had plenty to talk about. But our discussion kept turning to the clouds, which showed no signs of dissipating. The Sun was often veiled by thin cirrus or completely hidden by thick cumulus. We kept a nervous watch.</p>
<p>Time crawled as the Moon inched across the brilliant disk. It passed the midway point and the Sun became a crescent. With only twenty minutes before totality, my Belgian friends conversed in Dutch. The man turned to me. &#8220;We have decided to drive toward that hole in the clouds back to the east,&#8221; he said in French. &#8220;It&#8217;s really not looking so good here. Do you want to come with us?&#8221; I paused to think. How far away was that hole? Would we end up back at the town? Would we get caught in traffic? Would we end up somewhere low? What were my chances if I stayed where I was? I hesitated, unsure. If I went with them, I was subject to their whims, not my own. But after looking at the oncoming clouds one more time, I decided my present location was not favorable. I joined them.</p>
<p>We descended the dirt track and turned left onto the road I&#8217;d taken so long to walk. It was completely empty. We kept one eye on where we were going and five eyes on the sky. After two miles, the crescent sun became visible through a large gap in the low clouds. There were still high thin clouds slightly veiling it, but the sky around it was a pale blue. We went a bit further, and then stopped&#8230; at the very same dirt track where I had slept the night before. A line of ten or fifteen cars now stretched along it, but there was plenty of room for our vehicle.</p>
<p>By now, with ten minutes to go, the light was beginning to change. When only five percent of the Sun remains, your eye can really tell. The blues become deeper, the whites become milkier, and everything is more subdued. Also it becomes noticeably cooler. I&#8217;d seen this light before, in New Mexico in 1994. I had gone there to watch an &#8220;annular&#8221; eclipse of the Sun. An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun but is just a bit too far away from the Earth for its shadow to reach the ground. In such an eclipse, the Moon fails to completely block the Sun; a narrow ringlet, or &#8220;annulus&#8221;, often called the &#8220;ring of fire,&#8221; remains visible. That day I watched from a mountain top, site of several telescopes, in nearly clear skies. But imagine the dismay of the spectators as the four-and-a-half minutes of annularity were blocked by a five-minute cloud! Fortunately there was a bright spot. For a brief instant &#8212; no more than three seconds &#8212; the cloud became thin, and a perfect circle of light shone through, too dim to penetrate eclipse glasses but visible with the naked eye&#8230; a veiled, surreal vision.</p>
<p>On the dirt track in the middle of French fields, we started counting down the minutes. There was more and more tension in the air. I put faster speed film into my camera. The light became still milkier, and as the crescent became a fingernail, all eyes were focused either on the Sun itself or on a small but thick and dangerous-looking cloud heading straight for it. Except mine. I didn&#8217;t care if I saw the last dot of sunlight disappear. What I wanted to watch was the coming of Moon-shadow.</p>
<p>One of my motivations for seeking a hill was that I wanted to observe the approach of darkness. Three thousand miles an hour is just under a mile per second, so if one had a view extending out five miles or so, I thought, one could really see the edge coming. I expected it would be much like watching the shadow of a cloud coming toward me, with the darkness sweeping along the ground, only much darker and faster. I looked to the west and waited for the drama to unfold.</p>
<p>And it did, but it was not what I was expecting. Even though observing the shadow is a common thing for eclipse watchers to do, nothing I had ever read about eclipses prepared me in the slightest for what I was about to witness. I&#8217;ve never seen it photographed, or even described. Maybe it was an effect of all the clouds around us. Or maybe others, just as I do, find it difficult to convey.</p>
<p>For how can one relate the sight of daylight sliding swiftly, like an sigh, to deep twilight? of the western sky, seen through scattered clouds, changing seamlessly and inexorably from blue to pink to slate gray to the last yellow of sunset? of colors rising up out of the horizon and spreading across the sky like water from a broken dyke flooding onto a field?</p>
<p>I cannot find the right combination of words to capture the sense of being swept up, of being overwhelmed, of being transfixed with awe, as one might be before the summoning of a great wave or a great wind by the command of a god, yet all in utter silence and great beauty. Reliving it as I write this brings a tear. In the end I have nothing to compare it to.</p>
<p>The great metamorphosis passed. The light stabilized. Shaken, I looked up.</p>
<p>And quickly looked away. I had seen a near-disk of darkness, the fuzzy whiteness of the corona, and some bright dots around the disk&#8217;s edge, one especially bright where the Sun still clearly shone through. Accidentally I had seen with my naked eyes the &#8220;diamond ring,&#8221; a moment when the last brilliant drop of Sun and the glistening corona are simultaneously visible. It&#8217;s not safe to look at. I glanced again. Still several bright dots. I glanced again. Still there &#8212; but the Sun had to be covered by now&#8230;</p>
<p>So I looked longer, and realized that the Sun was indeed covered, that those bright dots were there to stay. There it was. The eclipsed Sun, or rather, the dark disk of the New Moon, surrounded by the Sun&#8217;s crown, studded at its edge with seven bright pink jewels. It was bizarre, awe-inspiring, a spooky hallucination. It shimmered.</p>
<p>The Sun&#8217;s corona didn&#8217;t really resemble what I had seen in photographs, and I could immediately see why. The corona looked as though it were made of glistening white wispy hair, billowing outward like a mop of whiskers. It gleamed with a celestial light, a shine resembling that of well-lit tinsel. No camera could capture that glow, no photograph reproduce it.</p>
<p>But the greatest, most delightful surprise was the seven beautiful gems. I knew they had to be the great eruptions on the surface of the Sun, prominences, huge magnetic storms larger than our planet and more violent than anything else in the solar system. However, nobody ever told me they were bright pink! I always assumed they were orange (silly of me, since the whole Sun looks orange if you look at it through an orange filter, which the photographs always do.) They were arranged almost symmetrically around the sun, with one of them actually well separated from its surface and halfway out into the lovely soft filaments of the corona. I explored them with my binoculars. The colors, the glistening timbre, the rich detail, it is a visual delight. The scene is living, vibrant, delicate and soft; by comparison, all the photographs and films seem dry, flat, deadened.</p>
<p>I was surprised at my calm. After the great rush of the shadow, the stasis of totality had caught me off guard.  Around me it was much lighter than I had expected. The sense was of late twilight, with a deep blue-purple sky; yet it was still bright enough to read by. The yellow light of late sunset stretched all the way around the horizon. The planet Venus was visible, but no stars peeked through the clouds. Perhaps longer eclipses have darker skies, a larger Moon-shadow putting daylight further away.</p>
<p>I had scarcely had time to absorb all of this when, just at the halfway point of totality, the dangerous-looking cumulus cloud finally arrived, and blotted out the view. A groan, but only a half-hearted one, emerged from the spectators; after all we&#8217;d seen what we&#8217;d come to see. I took in the colors emanating from the different parts of the sky, and then looked west again, waiting for the light to return. A thin red glow touched the horizon. I waited. Suddenly the red began to grow furiously. I yelled &#8220;Il revient!&#8221; &#8212; it is returning! &#8212; and then watched in awe as the reds became pinks, swarmed over us, turned yellow-white&#8230;</p>
<p>And then&#8230; it was daylight again. Normality, or a slightly muted version of it. The magical show was over, heavenly love had been consummated, we who had traveled far had been rewarded. The weather had been kind to us. There was a pause as we savored the experience, and waited for our brains to resume functioning. Then congratulations were passed around as people shook hands and hugged each other. I thanked my Belgian friends, who like me were smiling broadly. They offered me a ride back to town. I almost accepted, but stopped short, and instead thanked them again and told them I somehow wanted to be outside for a while longer. We exchanged addresses, said goodbyes, they drove off.</p>
<p>I started retracing my steps from the previous evening. As I walked back to the town of Rethel in the returning sunshine, the immensity of what I had seen began gradually to make its way through my skin into my blood, making me teary-eyed. I thought about myself, a scientist, educated and knowledgeable about the events that had just taken place, and tried to imagine what would have happened to me today if I had not had<br />
that knowledge and had found myself, unexpectedly, in the Moon&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p>It was not difficult; I had only to imagine what I would feel if the sky suddenly, without any warning, turned a fiery red instead of blue and began to howl. It would have been a living nightmare. The terror that I would have felt would have penetrated my bones. I would have fallen on my knees in panic; I would have screamed and wept; I would have called on every deity I knew and others I didn&#8217;t know for help; I would have despaired; I would have thought death or hell had come; I would have assumed my life was about to end. The two minutes of darkness, filled with the screams and cries of my neighbors, would have been timeless, maddening. When the Sun just as suddenly returned, I would have collapsed onto the ground with relief, profusely and weepingly thanking all of the deities for restoring the world to its former condition, and would have rushed home to relatives and friends, hoping to find some comfort and solace.</p>
<p>I would have sought explanations. I would have been willing to consider anything: dragons eating the Sun, spirits seeking to punish our village or country for its transgressions, evil and spiteful monsters trying to freeze the Earth, gods warning us of terrible things to come in future. But above all, <em>I could never, never have imagined that </em><em>this brief spine-chilling extinction and transformation of the Sun was a natural </em><em>phenomenon.</em> Nothing so spectacular and sudden and horrifying could have been the work of mere matter. It would once and for all have convinced me of the existence of creatures greater and more powerful than human beings, if I had previously had any doubt.</p>
<p>And I would have been forever changed. No longer could I have entirely trusted the regularity of days and nights, of seasons, of years. For the rest of my life I would have always found myself glancing at the sky, wanting to make sure that all, for the moment, was well. For if the Sun could suddenly vanish for two minutes, perhaps the next time it could vanish for two hours, or two days&#8230; or two centuries. Or forever.</p>
<p>I pondered the impact that eclipses, both solar and lunar, have had throughout human history. They have shaped civilizations. Wars and slaughters were begun and ended on their appearance; they sent ordinary people to their deaths as appeasement sacrifices; new gods and legends were invoked to give meaning to them. The need to predict them, and the coincidences which made their prediction possible, helped give birth to astronomy as a mathematically precise science, in China, in Greece, in modern Europe &#8212; developments without which my profession, and even my entire technologically-based culture, might not exist.</p>
<p>It was an hour&#8217;s walk to Rethel, but that afternoon it was a long journey. It took me across the globe to nations ancient and distant. By the time I reached the town, I&#8217;d communed with my ancestors, reconsidered human history, and examined anew my tiny place in the universe.  If I&#8217;d been a bit calm during totality itself, I wasn&#8217;t anymore. What I&#8217;d seen was gradually filtering, with great potency, into my soul.</p>
<p>I took the train back to Charleville, and slept dreamlessly. The next two days were an opportunity to unwind, to explore, and to eat well. On my last evening I returned to Paris to visit my old haunts. I managed to sneak into the courtyard of the apartment house where I had had a one-room garret up five flights of stairs, with its spartan furnishings and its one window that looked over the roofs of Paris to the Eiffel Tower. I wandered past the old Music Conservatory, since moved to the northeast corner of town, and past the bookstore where I bought so much music. My favorite bakery was still open.</p>
<p>That night I slept in an airport hotel, and the next day flew happily home to the American continent. I never did find my driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>But psychological closure came already on the day following the eclipse. I spent that day in Laon, a small city perched magnificently atop a rocky hill that rises vertically out of the French plains. I wandered its streets and visited its sights &#8212; an attractive church, old houses, pleasant old alleyways, ancient walls and gates. As evening approached I began walking about, looking for a restaurant, and I came to the northwestern edge of town overlooking the new city and the countryside beyond. The clouds had parted, and the Sun, looking large and dull red, was low in the sky. I leaned on the city wall and watched as the turning Earth carried me, and Laon, and all of France, at hundreds of miles an hour, intent on placing itself between me and the Sun. Yet another type of solar eclipse, one we call &#8220;sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruddy disk touched the horizon. I remembered the wispy white mane and the brilliant pink jewels. In my mind the Sun had always been grand and powerful, life-giver and taker, essential and dangerous. It could blind, burn, and kill.  I respected it, was impressed and awed by it, gave thanks for it, swore at it, feared it. But in the strange light of totality, I had seen beyond its unforgiving, blazing sphere, and glimpsed a softer side of the Sun. With its feathery hair blowing in a dark sky, it had seemed delicate, even vulnerable. It is, I thought to myself, as mortal as we.</p>
<p>The distant French hills rose across its face. As it waned, I found myself feeling a warmth, even a tenderness &#8212; affection for this giant glowing ball of hydrogen, this protector of our planet, this lonely beacon in a vast emptiness&#8230; the only star you and I will ever know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still kind of exhausted from the effort (<a title="Our Survey of Exotic Decays of the Higgs is Done" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/12/19/our-survey-of-exotic-higgs-decays-is-done/" target="_blank">see yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) of completing our survey of some of the many unexpected ways that the newly discovered <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> might decay. But I would be remiss if, before heading off into the holiday break, I didn&#8217;t issue some well-deserved congratulations.</p>
<div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71757000/jpg/_71757703_020360764-1.jpg" width="299" height="217" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Jade Rabbit rover on the surface of the Moon, 15 December. Credit:Xinhua</p></div>
<p>Congratulations, first, to China &#8212; to the scientists and engineers who&#8217;ve managed to put a lander and a rover on the Moon. If you think that&#8217;s easy&#8230; think again! And they succeeded on their first attempt, a real coup. Now let&#8217;s see what science they can do with it, exploring a region of the Moon that apparently may offer answers to important questions about the Moon&#8217;s history. Specifically, by accident or by design, <a href="http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/" target="_blank">the rover is going to be able to explore an area of considerable geological importance</a>, involving one of the Moon&#8217;s giant lava flows, a relatively young one (1-2.5 billion years rather than 3 billion or more).</p>
<div style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/29/Gaia_liftoff_12_625.jpg" width="263" height="394" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Soyuz VS06, with Gaia, lifted off from Europe&#8217;s Spaceport, French Guiana, on 19 December 2013. Copyright: ESA &#8211; S. Corvaja, 2013</p></div>
<p>Congratulations, next, to the scientists and engineers of the European Union, who&#8217;ve put a fantastic telescope into space, destined to orbit the sun. The Gaia mission is aimed at doing the extraordinary: mapping, with ultra-high precision, the locations and motions of no less than 1 billion stars within our galaxy &#8212; nearly 1% of the total number. The distance to each of these stars will be determined by <a title="Parallax: Seeing in Depth" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/parallax-seeing-in-depth/" target="_blank">parallax</a> &#8212; looking at how the positions of stars wobble, from the perspective of the spacecraft as it orbits the sun &#8212; and the real motions of the stars will be determined by how they drift across the sky, and by the <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/doppler.htm" target="_blank">Doppler effect</a> for light.  This wealth of information will help scientists figure out the shape and history of the galaxy to a degree never previously possible.  Meanwhile, Gaia will also be able to do a lot of other science, picking up distant supernovas outside our galaxy, nearby asteroids orbiting our sun, and signs of planets around other stars, as well as brown dwarfs (small failed stars) that may be floating around between the stars. Gaia can even check some aspects of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity! <a href="http://sci.esa.int/gaia/28890-objectives/" target="_blank">Read here</a> about all the wonderful things this mission can do.</p>
<p>Congratulations also to the scientists and engineers in Iran, who&#8217;ve apparently moved their rocketry program, and its potential application to human space flight, among other things, another step forward. A second monkey has made the trip to the edge of space, a suborbital trip. (Did the first survive? it&#8217;s not clear, and admittedly Iran is known for photo-shopping reality into supporting the story it wants to tell. Not that it matters; <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/animals.html" target="_blank">it took the US several tries</a>, back over 60 years ago, before a monkey survived the trip, and the survival rate continued to be poor for a while. )  Anyway, it puts Iran well on its way toward its goal of a human in space by 2018.</p>
<p>And finally, congratulations to my own country, the United States, for having <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/18/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE9BF1FW20131218" target="_blank">passed a budget deal.</a> Not out of the woods yet, but at least it was bipartisan, and we&#8217;re not yet talking about <a title="Help! I’m a Hostage! (D – 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/10/help-im-a-hostage-d-7/" target="_blank">another damaging government shutdown</a>, or worse, default. Politics isn&#8217;t rocket science. We&#8217;ll have to hope our politicians can learn something from China: that it&#8217;s good to find some common and worthy goals to work toward together, rather than to fight about absolutely everything and bring the nation&#8217;s operations to a halt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all read in books that Venus is a planet that orbits the Sun and is closer to the Sun than is the Earth. <strong><em>But why learn from books what you can check for yourself?!?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>[Note: If you missed Wednesday evening&#8217;s discussion of particle physics involving me, Sean Carroll and Alan Boyle, you can <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/12/05/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-sean-carroll-why-the-higgs-particle-matters" target="_blank">listen to it here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>As many feared, Comet ISON didn&#8217;t <a title="Comet ISON Befuddles the Experts" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/29/comet-ison-befuddles-the-experts/">survive</a> its <a title="Icy Comet ISON’s Trial By Fire" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/28/icy-comet-isons-trial-by-fire/">close visit</a> to the Sun, so there&#8217;s no reason to get up at 6 in the morning to go looking for it. <em>[You might want to look for <a href="http://waitingforison.wordpress.com/comet-lovejoy/" target="_blank">dim but pretty Comet Lovejoy</a>, however, barely visible to the naked eye from dark skies.]</em> At 6 in the evening, however, there&#8217;s good reason to be looking in the western skies &#8212; the Moon (for the next few days) and Venus (for the next few weeks) are shining brightly there.  Right now Venus is about as bright as it ever gets during its cycle.</p>
<p>The very best way to look at them is with binoculars, or a small telescope.  Easily with the telescope, and less easily with binoculars (you&#8217;ll need steady hands and sharp eyes, so be patient) you should be able to see that it&#8217;s not just the Moon that forms a crescent right now: Venus does too!</p>
<p>If you watch Venus in your binoculars or telescope over the next few weeks, you&#8217;ll see proof, with your own eyes, that Venus, like the Earth, orbits the Sun, and it does so at a distance <em>smaller</em> than the distance from the Sun to Earth.</p>
<p>The proof is simple enough, and Galileo himself provided it, by pointing his rudimentary telescope at the Sun 400 years ago, and watching Venus carefully, week by week.  What he saw was this: that when Venus was in the evening sky <em>(every few months it moves from the evening sky to the morning sky, and then back again; it&#8217;s never in both)</em>,</p>
<ul>
<li>it was first rather dim, low in the sky at sunset, and nearly a disk, though a rather small one;</li>
<li>then it would grow bright, larger, high in the sky at sunset, and develop a half-moon and then a crescent shape;</li>
<li>and finally it would drop lower in the sky again at sunset, still rather bright, but now a thin crescent that was even larger from tip to tip than before.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this is illustrated in the figure below, taken from <a title="Reflections on Beauty in Motion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/reflections-on-beauty-in-motion/" target="_blank">this post</a> <em>[which, although specific in some ways to the sky in February 2012, still has a number of general observations about the skies that apply at any time.]</em></p>

It is always largest when a crescent and smallest when full, and is brightest somewhere in between.</p></div>
<p>So go dig out those binoculars and telescopes, or use Venus as an excuse to buy new ones! Watch Venus, week by week, as it grows larger in the sky and becomes a thinner crescent, moving ever closer to the sunset horizon.  And a month from now the Moon, having made its orbit round the Earth, will return as a new crescent for you to admire.</p>
<p><em>Of course there&#8217;s another proof that Venus is closer to the Sun than Earth is: on very rare occasions Venus passes directly between the Earth and the Sun.  No more of those &#8220;transits&#8221; for a long time I&#8217;m afraid, but you can see <a href="http://www.space.com/15973-venus-transit-pictures-2012-gallery.html" target="_blank">pictures of last June&#8217;s transit here</a>, and <a title="Transit of Venus and the Distance to the Sun" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/transit-of-venus-and-the-distance-to-the-sun/" target="_blank">read about the great scientific value of such transits here</a>. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">Appropriate for General Readership</span></em></strong></pre>
<p>Tomorrow there will be a solar eclipse (i.e., the moon will pass between the earth and the sun, blocking the sun&#8217;s light.) Those of us on the east coast of the United States who wake up to a clear sky at dawn will see the rising sun <strong>partially</strong> eclipsed, as much as half blocked in many places. <em>[Don&#8217;t forget that in the US the clocks are changing tonight, so dawn is one hour earlier, as the clock tells it, than it was today; in New York City sunrise is at 6:30 am tomorrow.]</em> Meanwhile, a substantial <strong>partial</strong> eclipse will be visible across most of Africa, and a less substantial one in parts of southern Europe.  And a little sliver of central Africa will be fortunate enough to see one of nature&#8217;s most extraordinary spectacles: a <strong>total</strong> eclipse of the sun, where for a couple of minutes the sky suddenly goes almost dark, the stars come into view, and <a href="http://www.lucnix.be/v/Astronomy/Solar+eclipse+1999+Luc+Viatour.jpg.html" target="_blank">the pink prominences and silvery corona of the sun glow and shimmer</a> in the darkness of the moon&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p>Really, this ought to have been scheduled for Halloween.  Because if you didn&#8217;t know to expect a total solar eclipse, and you didn&#8217;t know what was going on, there&#8217;d be nothing more terrifying.</p>
<p>Remember: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>Except in the truly dark heart of a total eclipse, looking at the sun for even a few moments can destroy your eyes</strong></em></span>; either use specially designed &#8220;eclipse glasses&#8221; (ordinary sunglasses are <strong>completely unsafe</strong>) or <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/eclipses/3306081.html" target="_blank">use a pinhole in a piece of cardboard to project the sun&#8217;s image</a> onto a piece of paper or a wall. [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/06/07/transitions/" target="_blank">As I described here</a>, carefully placed binoculars pointed at a piece of paper or wall will work too &#8212; <strong>but do not look through them!!!</strong> just let the sun&#8217;s image go through.] For those watching at sunrise, if there is cloud or haze in the east that dims the sunlight, you can look for a few moments &#8212; but make it very quick!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m pleased to say that last night I found comet Pan-STARRS, which is gracing the western sky just after sunset, and so I can recommend now that you all give it a try.  Binoculars will definitely make it easier to find, and allow you to see more of it.  It looks great!  Here are some thoughts on how to find it, appropriate if you&#8217;re in a country at roughly the same latitude as the United States.  (If you live far to the north or far to the south, you&#8217;ll need to get advice from someone who found it in a latitude similar to yours.  I don&#8217;t believe people in the southern hemisphere can still see it.)<span id="more-5649"></span></p>
<p>At this latitude, the comet seems to be easiest to find 40-60 minutes after sunset, as twilight fades, and just a few minutes before the comet itself sets.  Because the comet is low in the sky, you&#8217;ll want to have a very clear view of the western horizon (where the sun has just set) with as few hills, buildings and trees blocking your view as possible.</p>
<p>Last night, the comet was directly to the left of the thin crescent moon, by several moon widths.  I spotted it with binoculars without much trouble &#8212; it is the brightest thing in that part of the sky, other than the moon itself.  <em>[Curiously, it didn&#8217;t seem to be where <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/news/comet20130307.html" target="_blank">the star charts I&#8217;ve been reading from NASA</a>, and elsewhere, said it would be &#8212; it was further from the moon than I expected, and the orientation seemed off.  Did anyone else notice this, or am I just wrong?] </em> It can be seen with the naked eye, but it&#8217;s much easier to find it first with binoculars!</p>
<p>Tonight (Wednesday), as you face west, the comet will be somewhat below and perhaps slightly to the left of the moon.  Thursday it will be much further below and probably a bit to the right.  After that the moon won&#8217;t serve as a guide, so the comet may become a bit tougher to find &#8212; though conversely it may also become easier, because it will be moving a bit further into darker skies and away from the horizon, making it show up more easily even to the naked eye.</p>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s well worth seeing the comet on more than one night, even on consecutive nights, because it is close enough to Earth, and moving so fast through the solar system, that it will appear in a different location (relative to the stars) every evening.</p>
<p>After the comet sets, there&#8217;s more for you to see.  The moon, of course, will look especially interesting in binoculars; with a crescent moon you may be able to see shadows and mountains at the edge of craters.  There&#8217;s also earth-shine, sunlight reflected off the earth and back to the moon, which may make the dark part of the moon glow faintly.  (Earth-shine was remarkably bright tonight!)  Then look straight overhead to spot Jupiter, largest planet in the solar system, and by far the brightest object in that part of the sky.  In binoculars, you will see the planet as a disk, not a point of light.  Also, you will probably notice two, three or four little star-like objects very close to the planet and lying in  a straight line that passes through Jupiter; those are some of Jupiter&#8217;s large moons, discovered by Galileo.  They too move noticeably every day; the one nearest Jupiter circles the planet every two Earth days.  Not far from Jupiter in the sky is the dense cluster of stars called the Pleiades; the seven stars visible to the naked eye become dozens in binoculars.  And finally, look at the constellation Orion, also nearly overhead, but toward the south. Below Orion&#8217;s belt (three bright equally spaced stars oriented horizontally at sunset) is his scabbard (three stars spaced vertically at that hour, not so far apart from one another as those in the belt).  If you look at the middle &#8220;star&#8221; in his scabbard you&#8217;ll notice it is a bit misty &#8212; because it&#8217;s actually <a href="http://www.enchantedskies.net/OrionScabbardBig.htm" target="_blank">the Orion Nebula</a>, a large region of gas and dust where new stars are forming.</p>
<p>With so many things to see, you&#8217;ll be glad you&#8217;re outdoors &#8212; especially if you have binoculars to help you appreciate the evening!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a modified version of <a title="The Grand Si11iness of 11/11/11 11:11:11" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/xotica/the-grand-si11iness-of-111111-111111/">last year&#8217;s 11/11/11 article</a>, in case you missed it. </em></p>
<p>Today is a special day &#8212; at least if you are fond of the number 12, and especially so if you&#8217;re willing to buy in to one of the oldest human pseudo-scientific pursuits: numerology. Oh, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love numbers and I always have. When I was five years old I was mesmerized when my parents&#8217; car reached 99,999.9 miles, and I think 12:34:56 on 7/8/90 is just a cool a time as anybody else does. But I do this with a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it happens that a few influential people attempt serious and consequential numerology involving the calendar &#8212; predicting disaster and convincing people to sell their homes and give away their belongings. Now that makes me mad. Outraged, in fact &#8212; because it&#8217;s often obvious from the way these predictions are generated that those who made them don&#8217;t understand much about the calendar, about time, about history and about astronomy or physics&#8230; and yet they speak with authority, an authority they haven&#8217;t earned and don&#8217;t deserve.</p>
<p>So as we celebrate this one-two-of-a-kind moment, let&#8217;s also remember, and enjoy, just how absurd it really is. Let us even count the ways.<span id="more-5154"></span></p>
<p><strong>Cycles and Compromise</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at our string of twelves: we are 12 years after the year 2000; 12 months and 12 days after the start of the year; 12 hours, 12 minutes and 12 seconds since midnight.</p>
<p>Each of the first three 12&#8217;s has something to do with astronomy &#8212; but if we look closely, something&#8217;s a little off.</p>
<p>First we need to count years, and a year is the time it takes the earth to orbit the sun. Almost. Not quite. An <strong>astronomical year</strong> is the time it takes the earth to orbit the sun. A <strong>calendar year</strong>? that&#8217;s something else.</p>
<p>Then we need to count months. A month, of course, is roughly a &#8220;moon&#8221;, the time between two full moons &#8230; and a full moon occurs at the moment that the sun is on one side of the earth and the moon is on the exact other side. In some calendars around the world and throughout history, a month is a moon &#8212; <em>but not in ours.</em></p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the day: the time it takes for the sun to go from overhead to setting and rising and back to overhead again.</p>
<p>The problem with all of these astronomical cycles is that they are not synchronized; there&#8217;s no reason why they should be, since they are separate accidents of nature. The number of moons in an astronomical year isn&#8217;t a nice number; nor is the number of days in an astronomical year, or in a moon.</p>
<p>The number of days in an astronomical year is close to 365 and a quarter, not 365 or 366. That&#8217;s why at some point it was decided<em> (by whom? and when? and on whose authority? it turns out our democratic society keeps track of its dates under the decree of a Roman emperor)</em> that we would have three years in a row of 365 days, and then a fourth year of 366 years &#8212; a &#8220;leap&#8221; year. That way, the number of days in four calendar years is just about 1461, which is just about four astronomical years. But even this isn&#8217;t exactly right, so thanks to Pope Gregory, 3 of every 400 years (most recently the years 1700, 1800, and 1900, but not 2000) we skip a leap year, to get back on track, and keep the astronomical and calendar years lined up. More or less. It&#8217;s still not perfect.</p>
<p>Of course this way of doing things is completely arbitrary! We could just as well have 19 years of 365 days, and then in the 20th year have an extra five days. Or we could go 99 years of 365 days, with an extra month of 25 days at the turn of the century. Indeed some calendar systems around the world do something just like that. If we&#8217;d decided to do either of those things, there wouldn&#8217;t have been a leap year in 2004 or 2008, and today wouldn&#8217;t be 12/12 at all! It would be 12/14.</p>
<p>Or if Pope Gregory had removed three leap years at the start of each 400 year cycle, eliminating them in 2000, 2004 and 2008 instead of in 2100, 2200 and 2300, again it would not be 12/12 today. And so forth.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s celebrate 12/12 &#8212; an accident of the leap year decisions of a Roman emperor and a Roman pope.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve hardly begun. Let&#8217;s talk about those months. The number of days in a moon is about 29 and a half, so a moon is neither 29 nor 30 days, which is sort of inconvenient. And worse, it also doesn&#8217;t divide 365 (or 366) very conveniently; a year is quite a bit more than 12 moons and quite a bit less than 13. So how did we end up with 12 months of 30 or 31 days (except for February)? Well, you can blame the Roman emperors for that too: we&#8217;ve inherited our calendar mainly from Julius Caesar (who got a month named after himself &#8212; a long one with 31 days) with adjustments by Augustus (who had the following month named after himself and made sure it too was one with 31 days). And so the days per month are all funny. Why not, you might ask, have 12 months alternating between 29 days and 30 days, and 1 extra mini-month of 11 days?</p>
<p>Or why not have the last month of the year be the short one, making February a month of 30 days and December a month of 29, instead of our current odd arrangement? That would be more sensible &#8212; and if we did that, then today would be 12/11, not 12/12.</p>
<p>Or how about this? What about 13 months of 28 days each, with the last month being 29? That&#8217;s 365 days. Wouldn&#8217;t that be simpler? Each month would be four weeks, with just one extra day tacked on at the end of the year. No muss, no fuss, no having to remember which months have 30 days and which have 31. Ah, but that would mean 13 (ooooooooo! scary!) months&#8230; which we all know would be terrible. (And today would be 13/11, not 12/12.)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s celebrate 12/12 &#8212; an accident of how a Roman military dictator chose the days of our calendar&#8217;s months, and perhaps also a consequence of the fear of the number 13.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get back to years, months and days in a minute and a second, but first let&#8217;s talk about 12:12:12 as a time.</p>
<p><strong>An Ancient Obsession with Twelve</strong></p>
<p>How did we end up dividing our day into 24 hours, each of which has 60 minutes, each of which has 60 seconds? Well, not everybody has counted on their ten fingers the way we do; some have counted <em>the joints on their fingers</em> (not including the thumb), of which we have 3 × 4 = 12 on each hand. Probably some have counted in other ways, but the fact that 12 was a special number for the Sumerians, Babylonians and Egyptians has resulted (through what appears to be a rather torturous history that I don&#8217;t claim to understand at all) in our having 12 hours for daytime and 12 for night, with 60 (which is 12 times 5) being the number of minutes in an hour and the number of seconds in a minute.</p>
<p>Our western culture does not share this obsession with 12. Our obsessions are with 10, and indeed that&#8217;s why Europeans worked to convince most of the world (except for the stubborn United States) to go over to a metric system, which is all based on 10s, 100s, 1000s, etc., in analogy to the way we in Europe and its former colonies (and many other human cultures) count. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, 100 centimeters in a meter, 10 millimeters in a centimeter, and so forth. So how did we avoid ending up with a metric <strong>clock</strong>, and find ourselves stuck with timekeeping that harkens back to numerical preferences over 4000 years old?</p>
<p>The French actually tried a metric clock after their revolution, and indeed it would have worked rather well. With 24 hours, 60 minutes and 60 seconds, our day has a total of 86,400 seconds and 1440 minutes. If instead we made the second just about 15 percent shorter and the minute just about 15 percent longer, we could have 100,000 seconds per day, organized as 10 hours of 100 minutes, each with 100 seconds. Now wouldn&#8217;t that make more sense? No more having to figure out that a 140 minute movie is two hours and twenty minutes. No more making that silly mistake that we&#8217;ve all made, forgetting that 1 minute and 30 seconds is shorter than 100 seconds. Noon occurs at 5:00, Midnight at 10:00. All very simple.</p>
<p>Sadly, with that arrangement, no time during the day would be 12:12:12. So much for that. You&#8217;d have to reserve your excitement for 9:99:99. (Which actually sounds just as exciting to me &#8212; the last second before midnight.)</p>
<p>Of course we&#8217;d have to give up many other things. Those beautiful European clock towers would become anachronistic (pardon the pun.) No more &#8220;eleventh-hour solutions,&#8221; or &#8220;clock striking twelve&#8221; either. And we&#8217;d have to get used to the fact that a quarter of an hour &#8212; 0.25 hours &#8212; would be a sensible 25 minutes, not 15. Well, it&#8217;s certainly a little late for this change, reasonable as it would have been; we should have done it before the digital age.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s enjoy 12:12:12 by honoring the Sumerians and Babylonians who made it all possible, and celebrating those who successfully defeated the French Revolution and prevented the metric system from taking over timekeeping.</p>
<p>By the way, this raises another issue: how we get &#8217;12 from 2012. It happens we count years by 10s. 2012 is two thousand plus zero hundred plus ten plus two years. And when we write the year using two digits, we just strip off the &#8220;20&#8221;. But of course that&#8217;s arbitrary: we don&#8217;t count hours, minutes or seconds by 10s, and we don&#8217;t write the 1012th minute of the day by stripping off the 10. Instead, the 1012th minute of the day is what we call 4:52 in the afternoon, or 16:52 on a 24-hour clock. And we could have done the same thing with years: we could count 60 years as a cycle, and then 2012 would be the 32st year in the 34th cycle, which would then make today more naturally 12/12/32. In fact, that&#8217;s exactly what the Chinese do. However, their calendar doesn&#8217;t share our year 1; their last 60 year cycle started in 1984, so they refer to this year not as &#8217;12 or &#8217;32, but as &#8217;29.</p>
<p><strong>The Arbitrary Starting Points</strong></p>
<p>And why is it 2012 anyway? That&#8217;s 2012 years from when? Of course it is from when the Christian (or &#8220;Common&#8221;) Era began, ostensibly from the year of the date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth. But Jesus was born during or just after the reign of Herod the Great (so say two of the Gospels rather clearly). Herod is well-known from other non-religious historical sources, too. These sources also have dates, and it is clear, comparing them, that Herod died in what we now call 4 B.C. In other words, our calendar is <em>wrong</em>; it starts at the wrong year. (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9693576/Jesus-was-born-years-earlier-than-thought-claims-Pope.html" target="_blank">Even the Pope agrees, now.</a>) The original estimate of when to set the year 1, made around the year 525, was simply mistaken; the historical knowledge available back then was not sufficient to make a correct estimate. And we can&#8217;t precisely fix the mistake now, because even today the historical data doesn&#8217;t make it clear <em>exactly</em> which year is the right one. So. Is it 2012? Or 2016? Or 2017? Or 2018?</p>
<p>Of course there are other cultures out there who might not agree that it is anywhere close to 2012. The Jewish calendar says it is 5773. The Chinese calendar says it is 4710. There are Buddhist calendars used in large portions of Asia that put the year at 2556; in Tibet the year is 2139. From the astronomical or the philosophical point of view, the setting of year 1 is arbitrary, and throughout human history there have been many calendars setting the starting year in different ways.</p>
<p>Ok, that&#8217;s one 12 down; now what about the fact that December is the 12th month? Hmm. &#8220;December.&#8221; What does that mean? Well, let&#8217;s see. September, October, November, December&#8230; oh, right! Seventh-month, Eight-month, Ninth-month, Tenth-month&#8230; wait a second! How did December end up with this name when it is the 12th month in our calendar?</p>
<p>Well, go back to early Roman republican times, and you&#8217;ll find December was the tenth month &#8212; the year started in the spring, in March. There was a change made for political convenience during the Roman republic, back in what we now call 153 B.C.E. (of course they didn&#8217;t call it that), putting January at the start of the year. Were it not for this change, today would be 10/12, and we&#8217;d be waiting til February, then the twelfth month (which is why it is the short month!) to celebrate today&#8217;s numerical excitement.</p>
<p>Then there is still a question of which <em>day</em> is to be denoted the first of the year: the first day of the first month. Why is the first day of January the day when we start the year? It&#8217;s not the solstice (December 21st or 22nd typically) &#8212; the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere and the longest in the southern &#8212; which would seem to be a natural day on which to mark the beginning of the year. And it&#8217;s not the equinox, the start of spring in the northern hemisphere, when day and night are of equal length across the globe. It&#8217;s a completely arbitrary day, and the position of the earth in its orbit on what we call January 1st has even shifted as adjustments have been made to our calendar. If we had put the start of the year on the solstice, but kept the months laid out the same way, we&#8217;d be at 12/23 by now, not 12/12.</p>
<p>Indeed, the arbitrariness of the date has been noticed before. For many centuries, different parts of Europe celebrated the new year on various days other than January 1st. And today many other cultures around the world start the year on another day. The Chinese start the year toward the end of February; for them we are not in the 12th month yet. The Jewish calendar has its New Year sometime in September; we&#8217;re not even into the 4th month. And so on. In short, there&#8217;s nothing intrinsically special about starting the year where we do, and so only for societies using Pope Gregory&#8217;s calendar (a minority of the world&#8217;s population) is today the twelfth day of the twelfth month.</p>
<p>So a toast to the Roman republic, without which we&#8217;d be in the wrong month. And also to Pope Gregory, who from the Vatican in Rome repaired Julius Caesar&#8217;s legacy with a one-time removal of 10 days from the calendar; without him we&#8217;d be on the wrong day. And finally to the Roman monk Dionysius Exiguus, who was perhaps worshiping Dionysus when he calculated the year 1; without him, it wouldn&#8217;t be &#8217;12. We should definitely be drinking these toasts with Italian wine.</p>
<p><strong>Time After Time</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s set the date aside again and go back to the time. 12:12:12 &#8212; 12 hours, 12 minutes, 12 seconds &#8212; after what? After midnight of course. Ah. Which midnight?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s <strong>astronomical midnight</strong> &#8212; the moment when your particular <em>point</em> on earth is exactly opposite the sun. And then there&#8217;s <strong>clock midnight</strong> &#8212; the moment when your <em>time zone</em> celebrates the start of a new day. These aren&#8217;t, generally, the same. In fact, astronomical midnight occurs about an hour earlier at the east edge of a time zone that it does at the west edge.</p>
<p>I say &#8220;about an hour earlier&#8221; because <a href="http://www.worldtimezone.com/" target="_blank">the time zones that we use around the world aren&#8217;t exact divisions of the earth into 24 equal slices</a>, like an orange cut into equal wedges. In principle they should be, but they&#8217;re adjusted for a very non-astronomical reason &#8212; political concerns and societal convenience. It was judged inconvenient for the US state of Texas to be in two time zones, so the time zone dividing line was adjusted to put the entire state in the same zone. The union of Europe has led most of western and central continental Europe, from Spain to Poland, to join a single time zone; the United Kingdom, due north of France, remains in a different zone, even though, as Paris is almost due south of London, astronomical time in London and Paris are only about 10 minutes apart. In some parts of Europe, 12:12:12 occurs well before astronomical 11 o&#8217;clock! And then there&#8217;s China, a country the width of the continental United States. China uses a single time zone, while the continental US uses four. The time 12:12:12 occurs all at once across China, while it happens at four different hours across the United States.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even more arbitrariness hidden here. Astronomical midnight in Washington D.C. occurs fifteen minutes or so after astronomical midnight in New York, but then again, <em>neither</em> city&#8217;s astronomical midnight is the same as clock midnight within their shared time zone. In a given time zone, whose <em>astronomical</em> midnight determines the <em>clock</em> midnight? Due to a historical accident, the time zones were set in the 1880s as follows: astronomical midnight in the English town of Greenwich is set as clock midnight in the London time zone, and then all other time zones worldwide differ by one hour, two hours, three hours, and so on. (There are exceptions, where the shift involves an additional half hour [<em>e.g.</em>, all of India], or an additional fifteen minutes.) If human history had played out a little differently, and astronomical midnight in the London time zone had been set by astronomical midnight in the Swiss city of Geneva, then what we call 12:12:12 in New York would instead be called 11:55:32, or something like that. (I didn&#8217;t actually calculate the precise time shift; that&#8217;s an exercise for the reader.)</p>
<p>In short, if we want to measure 12:12:12 from <em>astronomical</em> midnight, the problem is that it doesn&#8217;t occur when the clock says 12:12:12; it may happen when the clock says 11:58:34, or 12:24:06, depending on exactly where we are located within our time zone. And if instead we do want to use clock time, we should remember that if it weren&#8217;t for the historical progression that set the London time zone on Greenwich astronomical time, then again our clocks would be shifted away from where we find them today.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s celebrate 12:12:12 &#8212; a time that, but for the grace of history and the strength and scientific prowess of the British Empire, might easily have been shifted by as much as half an hour in either direction &#8212; and in some countries with extended time zones, by as much as two or three hours!</p>
<p><strong>Today and Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>We have one more great accident to thank for today being 12/12/12 here in North and South America. I refer to the location of the International Date Line. It&#8217;s one thing to set all the time zones &#8212; starting from midnight in one time zone, around through noon, and back to midnight as you go round the world &#8212; so that they give roughly the same clock time as astronomical time. But you still have to decide what day it is. And it can&#8217;t be the same day everywhere on the earth at the same time! For instance, if it is midnight in London, it is after midnight in Moscow and before midnight in New York&#8230; so if London&#8217;s calendar says it is July 2nd, then so does Moscow&#8217;s, while in New York you would think it is July 1st. But then in San Francisco it is a few hours earlier on July 1st, and in Tokyo it is even earlier on July 1st; still earlier in Beijing and in New Delhi on July 1st; and back we come to Moscow very early on &#8230; July 1st??? Whoops! A contradiction. Somewhere around the earth we have to make the day jump. And that&#8217;s what the International Date Line is for. When you cross that line, the calendar day has to jump by one. That line is completely arbitrary too. It was placed at a convenient value of longitude, right down the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where it intersects no continents except for a corner of Siberia, and affects rather few people, mainly on small islands. So when it is before midnight on July 1st in New York and San Francisco, it is midday on July 2nd in Tokyo. And when it is 12/12/12 at 12:12 in the morning in New York, it is 12/13/12 in Tokyo already; Tokyo is not 11 hours <em>behind</em> New York, it is 24 &#8211; 11 = 13 hours <em>ahead</em>.</p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s another place where the International Date Line could have been conveniently placed: down the middle of the Atlantic. There&#8217;s just enough room between the continents to squeeze it in. And if that were the case, instead of New York being 5 hours <em>behind</em> London time, it would be 24 &#8211; 5 = 19 hours <em>ahead</em> of London time. In other words, it would already be 12/13/12 here in North and South America.</p>
<p>Thus we celebrate 12/12/12 here in New York today because of the location and shapes of the continents and the oceans, and because of the arbitrary choice to locate the International Date Line on the ocean between the Americas and Asia, and not on the ocean that separates the Americas from Europe and Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Rant</strong></p>
<p>By this point I hope you have a very healthy distrust of date-based and time-based numerology. Up to now it&#8217;s been fun, but I also want to remind you how this gets misused. For instance, let&#8217;s recall Harold Camping, former head of Family Radio Stations, whose ludicrous prophesies of the end of the world led many of his followers to give their money to his ministry and to dispense with all their worldly belongings. Yet it was completely obvious he was a solatic. (A lunatic is a person who becomes crazy when in the presence of the moon; but Camping was obviously nuts in broad daylight.) This became clear when not only did he predict a date &#8212; May 21, 2011 &#8212; of the earth&#8217;s destruction, but also a time: 6 p.m.</p>
<p><em>Ummm.. that&#8217;s 6 p.m. <strong>where</strong>? according to whose clock?<br />
</em></p>
<p>Camping&#8217;s answer: local time.</p>
<p><em>Is that astronomical time or clock time?</em></p>
<p>The answer wasn&#8217;t very sharp, but seemed to be: clock time.</p>
<p><em>Is that Standard Time or Daylight Savings Time?</em> (A chunk of the Northern Hemisphere, heading into its summer, was on Daylight Savings time. The Southern Hemisphere, heading into its winter, was not.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we ever got an answer to that.</p>
<p>So: we were asked to believe that Camping was brilliant enough to carry out the numerology necessary to determine, from a document written down and unchanged for more than 1600 years, that divine forces would begin to destroy the earth on a particular date this year. And yet we learned, from his own predictions, that he was silly enough to infer from this ancient document that the destruction would start at the International Date Line (an arbitrary human convention that dates back only 125 years) and at 6 pm (using a method of timekeeping that is a human convention and did not exist even 200 years ago) working its way time zone by time zone (even though time zones are a human convention that dates back 125 years, and the time zones are heavily modified from astronomical time by political redrawings of their boundaries) and would perhaps even destroy the Southern and Northern hemispheres at slightly different rates because of the use of Daylight Savings Time in some northern regions.</p>
<p>In short, we learned Harold Camping doesn&#8217;t know too much about the real world.</p>
<p>It might be worth mentioning that when the New Testament was written down, the mistake of getting year 1 of the Christian era in the wrong place hadn&#8217;t happened yet. And of course Pope Gregory hadn&#8217;t removed his 10 days from the calendar yet either. I&#8217;m not sure, of course, but I&#8217;m willing to bet Camping didn&#8217;t know about these issues and probably didn&#8217;t correct for them.</p>
<p>So since Camping clearly didn&#8217;t understand some basic issues in timekeeping, why in heaven&#8217;s name did anyone give him the time of day, much less millions of dollars? And why couldn&#8217;t we have stopped him from damaging the lives of so many innocent people? It is too late for Camping&#8217;s followers, but perhaps we can be better prepared for the next round. At least, we should bring justifiable discredit on this type of numerology, pointing out its many logical flaws.</p>
<p><strong>End of rant</strong></p>
<p>There; I&#8217;m finally done. So glasses up, and let&#8217;s make a final toast to 12/12/12 12:12:12 &#8212; a consequence of misaligned astronomical orbital periods, calculation errors, ancient political decisions, Western hegemony, human physiology, historical anachronisms, religious doctrine, and Babylon. On the absurdity scale from one to ten, it surely scores a twelve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A number of transitions to talk about:</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m participating in a <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>panel discussion today</strong></span> (Thursday June 7th) on the transition that has seen me add science writer and popularizer to my resume&#8217;. Here&#8217;s the link&#8230; <span style="color:#800000;"><em><a href="http://sonyc12.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#800000;">free tickets required, click here for details and tickets</span></a>. </em><em>Sponsored by SoNYC (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/SoNYC/204659226216882" target="_blank"><span style="color:#800000;">Science online New York City</span></a>), panel discussion entitled &#8220;Reaching out of the Ivory Tower&#8221;, about the experiences of scientists who are reaching out to the public. </em>Panelists: Ethan Perlstein, Sarah Weisberg, Matt Strassler, Jeanne Garbarino.  Location and time: <a href="http://www.rockefeller.edu/about/campusmap" target="_blank"><strong>Weiss 305, </strong>Rockefeller University</a>, East 66th and York Ave. New York, NY, 7:00 PM.</span>   Presenting science to the public in a digestible but honest form is something I feel is important, and I&#8217;ll have a few words to say about why I chose to do it now and why via a website and blog. And then I guess the floor will be open to questions, so come on by and ask one!</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Reminder: again in New York, Saturday June 16th at 2pm, I&#8217;ll be giving a lecture (<a href="http://nycskeptics.org/events/matt-strassler.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">click here for details</span></a>):  THE EINSTEIN OBSESSION: SCIENCE, MYTH AND PUBLIC PERCEPTION.</em></span></p>
<p>Next: I hope you all enjoyed seeing Venus in transit across the Sun Tuesday, in whatever method you chose. If you missed it live, there are of course opportunities to see films of the event &#8212; and they&#8217;ll save you time, since they&#8217;re all speeded up so that the hours pass in a minute or so. Nice views of Venus are complemented by several good-sized sunspots that are roughly the size of the Earth. Venus, you may recall, is the same size as the Earth, but as it was only a third as far away as the Sun yesterday, it appeared three times larger in radius (10 times larger in surface radius) than those sunspots. I managed to see it with the naked eye (with eclipse glasses), but just barely&#8230; so tiny! (By the way, if you missed my article on how a transit of Venus was used to obtain the first high-precision measurement of the distance to the sun, <a title="Transit of Venus and the Distance to the Sun" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/transit-of-venus-and-the-distance-to-the-sun/">here&#8217;s the link</a>.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of my own best shots, which I show you not because you can&#8217;t find better shots on the internet but because I have learned that most people do not realize you can get such nice views of the sun with so little work.</p>

Strassler 2012, all rights reserved.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s really quite easy.  And though there won&#8217;t be any more transits of Venus for us to see, there will be bigger sunspots, transits of Mercury, and solar eclipses to watch over the coming 15 years, so you may as well learn how to do this. You just aim the binoculars, big side toward the sun (as though someone were going to look at the sun &#8212; BUT DON&#8217;T LET ANYONE LOOK, of course), in the rough direction of the sun, wiggle the binoculars until the shadow of the binoculars becomes as small as it possibly can (which tells you they are aligned with the sun) and at that point the sun will shine through the two sides of the binoculars, giving you two images. Put a lens cover on one of the sides if you want to just get one image. Then let the image project onto something white and smooth that can serve as a screen. By moving the screen forward or back you can get a larger or smaller image; by using the focus on the binoculars you can bring the image of the sun into focus. Works great!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture, taken in a similar way, from <a title="The Longest Sunset" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/22/the-longest-sunset/" target="_blank">the annular eclipse last month</a> &#8212; a <strong>transit of the moon</strong>, even though we don&#8217;t usually call it that &#8212; taken the same way. I like this shot (though focus is imperfect and it was taken from a funny angle) because where the moon&#8217;s shadow touches the sun&#8217;s limb you can see a bit of light shining between mountain ranges on the moon!</p>

<p>Venus, passing between the Sun and the Earth on Tuesday, has now <a title="Reflections on Beauty in Motion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/reflections-on-beauty-in-motion/" target="_blank">transitioned from an object in the evening sky to one in the morning sky</a>; if you want to see it, large and a very thin crescent through binoculars, you&#8217;ll need to get up early, before sunrise.  Not yet, though; it will be a few days before Venus is far enough from the Sun to pick out in the dawn sky.  For now, you can <a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime/c3/512/" target="_blank">see Venus via the SOHO satellite</a>, which blots out the sun so what&#8217;s nearby can be observed.</p>
<p>A final transition: Ray Bradbury died. Bradbury was one of the 20th century&#8217;s great science fiction writers, and I especially enjoyed reading his stories because he didn&#8217;t write classic geeky science fiction. His work was much more thoughtful and human than that. I think one could make a case that what made his writing unique was that he didn&#8217;t separate science from the rest of life.  It&#8217;s a good example for the rest of us to follow.</p>

<p>Quite a first visit to the North Rim of the canyon.  Maximum eclipse occurred an hour before sunset, and the sun set with a small piece of the moon&#8217;s silhouette still covering its disk.  As a result, the amount of sunlight remained low for the entire hour, bathing the canyon in the low light that allows its layers of color and geological time to be more easily seen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the other direction the sun was still far too bright to look at with the naked eye, or photograph without a filter. Lacking both a proper filter and a tripod, this is all I could manage with my camera, I&#8217;m afraid:</p>

<p>I think that when you look at photos of an eclipse (certainly I find this for myself) it is easy to miss the visceral nature of the experience. When you are watching it happen, you can see <em>(through a proper filter, or with a projection)</em>, second by second, the slow but steady glide of the moon across the sun. You can detect the ring of sunlight changing shape, from a perfect circle to one that is thicker on one side than the other, and finally turning back into a crescent. The process is a dynamic one, as well as a visual feast. And this is part of what makes it so beautiful &#8212; not just what one sees with the eyes, but what one feels as a witness to the steady motion of the heavens.</p>
<p><em>[p.s. don&#8217;t miss <a title="Three Crescents and a Ring" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/20/three-crescents-and-a-ring/">the other two crescents</a> to see right now: crescent Venus and crescent Moon near each other in the western sky tonight!]</em></p>
