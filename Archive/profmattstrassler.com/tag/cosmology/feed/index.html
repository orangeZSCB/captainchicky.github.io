										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is not dangerous and will not destroy the universe.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is a type of <em>particle</em>, a little ripple in the Higgs <em>field</em>. <em>[See <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">here for the Higgs FAQ</a>.]</em> This lowly particle, if you&#8217;re lucky enough to make one (and at the world&#8217;s largest particle accelerator, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, only one in a trillion proton-proton collisions actually does so) has a brief life, <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">disintegrating to other particles</a> in less than the time that it takes light to cross from one side of an atom to another. (Recall that light can travel from the Earth to the Moon in under two seconds.) Such a fragile creature is hardly more dangerous than a <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/189544/mayfly" target="_blank">mayfly</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who says otherwise probably read Hawking&#8217;s book (or read about it in the press) but didn&#8217;t understand what he or she was reading, perhaps because he or she had not read <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to worry about something Higgs-related, you can <em>try</em> to worry about the Higgs field, which is &#8220;ON&#8221; in our universe, though not nearly as &#8220;on&#8221; as it could be. If someone were to turn the Higgs field OFF, let&#8217;s say as a practical joke, that would be a disaster: all ordinary matter across the universe would explode, because the <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons on the outskirts of atoms</a> would <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">lose their mass and fly off into space</a>. This is not something to worry about, however. We know it would require an input of energy and can&#8217;t happen spontaneously.  Moreover, the amount of energy required to artificially turn the Higgs field off is immense; to do so even in a small room would require energy comparable to that of a typical supernova, an explosion of a star that can outshine an entire galaxy and releases the vast majority of its energy in unseen neutrinos. No one, fortunately, has a supernova in his or her back pocket. And if someone did, we&#8217;d have more immediate problems than worrying about someone wasting a supernova trying to turn off the Higgs field in a basement somewhere.</p>
<p>Now it would also be a disaster if someone could turn the Higgs field WAY UP&#8230; more than when your older brother turned up the volume on your stereo or MP3 player and blew out your speakers. In this case atoms would violently collapse, or worse, and things would be just as nasty as if the Higgs field were turned OFF. Should you worry about this? Well, it&#8217;s possible this could happen spontaneously, so it&#8217;s slightly more plausible. But I do mean slightly. <strong><em>Very</em></strong> slightly.<span id="more-7739"></span></p>
<p>Recently, physicists have been writing about this possibility because if (a) you <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>ASSUME</strong></span> that the types of particles that we&#8217;ve discovered so far are the <em>only</em> ones that affect the Higgs field, and (b) you <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ASSUME</span></strong> that there are no other important forces that affect the Higgs field other than the ones we know, then you can calculate, with <em>some</em> degree of reliability (though there is a debate about that degree) that (1) the Higgs field could lower the energy of the universe by suddenly jumping from ON to WAY WAY SUPER-DUPER ON, and (2) that the time we&#8217;d have to wait for it to do so spontaneously isn&#8217;t infinite.  It would do this in two steps: first a bubble of WAY WAY ON Higgs field would form <em>(via the curious ability of quantum mechanics to make the improbable happen, rarely)</em>, and then that bubble would expand and sweep across the universe, destroying everything in its path.</p>
<p><em>An aside: In particle physics <a title="Modern Physics: Increasingly Vacuous" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/08/modern-physics-increasingly-vacuous/">lingo explained here</a>, we say that &#8220;the universe has two possible &#8216;vacua&#8217;, the vacuum we live in, in which the Higgs field is ON a bit, and a second vacuum in which the Higgs field is HUGELY ON.&#8221; If the second vacuum has lower energy than the first, then the first vacuum is said to be &#8220;metastable&#8221;: although it lasts a very long time, it has a very small but non-zero probability of turning into the second vacuum someday.  That&#8217;s because a bubble of the second vacuum that appears by chance inside the first vacuum will expand, and take over the whole universe.</em></p>
<p>Ok. First, should you buy the original assumptions? No. It&#8217;s just humans assuming that what we currently know is all there is to know; since when has that been true?  Second, even if you do buy them, should you worry about the conclusion? No. The universe has existed in its current form for about 13.7 billion years. The Higgs field may not perform this nasty jump for trillions of years, or trillions of trillions, or trillions of trillions of trillions, or more. Likely more. In any case, nobody knows, but really, nobody should care very much. The calculation is hard, the answer highly uncertain, and worse, the whole thing is profoundly dependent on the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ASSUMPTIONS</span></strong>. In fact, if the assumptions are slightly wrong &#8212; if there are other particles and forces that affect the Higgs field, or if there is more than one Higgs-like field in nature &#8212; then the calculation could end up being way off from the truth. Also possible is that the calculational method, which is subtle, isn&#8217;t yet refined enough to give the right answer.  Altogether, this means that not only might the Higgs field&#8217;s nasty jump be much more or less likely than is currently believed, it might not even be possible at all. So we don&#8217;t actually <em>know</em> anything for sure, despite all the loose talk that suggests that we do.  But in any case, since the universe has lived 13.7 billion years already, the chance is <strong><em>ridiculously tiny</em></strong> that this Higgs field jump, even if it is possible at all, will occur in your ultra-short 100 year-ish lifetime, or even that of any of your descendants.</p>
<p>What about the possibility that human beings could <em>artificially</em> cause the Higgs field to turn WAY WAY ON? Again, the amount of energy involved in trying to do that is extremely large &#8212; not a supernova, now, but far, far beyond current human capability, and likely impossible.  (The technology required to build a particle accelerator with collisions at this energy, and the financial and environmental cost of running it, are more than a little difficult to imagine.)  At this point we can barely make Higgs bosons &#8212; little ripples in the Higgs field; now you want to imagine us making a bubble where the Higgs field is WAY WAY WAY MORE ON than usual? We&#8217;re scientists, not magicians. And we deal in science &#8212; i.e., reality.  Current and foreseeable technology cannot turn this imaginary possibility into reality.</p>
<p>Some dangers actually exist in reality. Asteroidlets do sometimes hit the earth; supernovas do explode, and a nearby one would be terrible; and you should not be wandering outdoors or in a shower during a lightning storm.  As for the possible spontaneous destruction of the universe? Well, if it happens some day, it may have nothing to do with the Higgs field; it may very well be due to <em>some other</em> field, about which we currently know <em>nothing</em>, making a jump of a sort that we haven&#8217;t even learned about yet. Humans tend to assume that the things they know about are much scarier than they actually are (e.g. Yellowstone, the &#8220;super&#8221;-volcano) and that the things they don&#8217;t know about are much less scary than they actually are (e.g. what people used to think about ozone-destroying chemicals before they knew they destroyed ozone.) This is worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>So anyone who tells you that we <em>know</em> that the universe is only &#8220;meta-stable&#8221;, and that someday the Higgs field will destroy it by suddenly screaming at the top of its lungs, or that we might cause it to do so, is forgetting to tell you about all the assumptions that went into that conclusion, and about the incredible energies required which may far exceed what humans can ever manage, and about the incredible lengths of time that may be involved, by which point there may be no more stars left to keep life going anyway, and possibly not even any more protons to make atoms out of. There&#8217;s a word for this kind of wild talk: &#8220;scare-mongering&#8221;.  You can safely go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Or not. There&#8217;s plenty to keep you awake. But by comparison with the spread of the Ebola virus, the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and acidification of the oceans, or the accelerating loss of the world&#8217;s biodiversity, not to mention the greed and violence common in our species, worrying about Higgs bosons, or even the Higgs field in which a Higgs particle is a tiny ripple, seems to me a tempest in a top quark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago there was (justified) hullabaloo following <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the release of results from the BICEP2 experiment</a>, which (if correct as an experiment, and if correctly interpreted) may indicate the detection of gravitational waves that were generated at an extremely early stage in the universe (or at least in its current phase)&#8230; during a (still hypothetical but increasingly plausible) stage known as <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.  (Here&#8217;s my description of the <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">history of the early universe</a> as we currently understand it, and my cautionary tale on <a title="Which Parts of the Big Bang Theory are Reliable, and Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/26/which-parts-of-the-big-bang-theory-are-reliable/" target="_blank">which parts of the history are well understood (and why) and which parts are not</a>.)</p>
<p>During that wild day or two following the announcement, a number of scientists stated that this was &#8220;the first <strong>direct</strong> observation of gravitational waves&#8221;.  Others, including me, emphasized that this was an &#8220;<strong>indirect</strong> observation of gravitational waves.&#8221;  I&#8217;m sure many readers noticed this discrepancy.  Who was right?</p>
<p>No one was wrong, not on this point anyway.  It was a matter of perspective. Since I think some readers would be interested to understand this point, here&#8217;s the story, and you can make your own judgment.<span id="more-7610"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll describe</p>
<ol>
<li>a past observation of gravitational waves that everyone agrees is indirect;</li>
<li>a future observation of gravitational waves that we expect to happen fairly soon, one that I believe everyone will agree is direct;</li>
<li>BICEP2, and how you can view it either way, depending on your perspective.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A Past <span style="color:#800000;">Indirect</span> Observation of Gravitational Waves</strong></p>
<p>First, let me describe what everyone agrees was the first observation of gravitational waves, and was definitely <strong>indirect</strong>.  In 1974, two scientists (Joseph Taylor and his graduate student Russell Hulse) discovered a pulsar.  A pulsar is a city-sized neutron star (made entirely from <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a> and resulting from a <a title="Supernovas and Neutrino Speeds" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/supernovas-and-neutrino-speeds/" target="_blank">Type IIa supernova</a>) that spins rapidly &#8212; rotating many times per second &#8212; and, due to its powerful magnetic field, sends strong radio beams into space, which sweep past the Earth as the pulsar spins.  We observe this as a pulsing radio signal from the location of the star.</p>
<p>Pulsars are common, but this one was special.  Its frequency of pulsing (i.e. how many times per second does it pulse) varied slightly, growing and shrinking every 7 hours and 45 minutes.  It quickly became clear this was due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Doppler_effect" target="_blank">the Doppler effect for radio waves</a>; the pulsar was sometimes moving toward us, and sometimes away, because <em>it was in orbit around something else</em>.  Detailed study (using the Newton/Einstein laws of gravity) allowed Hulse and Taylor to infer that what they were seeing was a pulsar orbiting a second neutron star.  They could even figure out the orientation and size of the orbit!</p>
<p>Having figured this out, they could do one more thing.  Einstein&#8217;s laws of gravity predict that the gravitational waves &#8212; waves in space itself &#8212; that are created by these two stars as they orbit one another, and these waves should be carrying energy out into space, reducing the energy available to the two stars.  The effect of this loss of energy would be a very mild reduction in the time (or &#8220;period&#8221;) that it takes for the two stars to orbit each other &#8212; but not by very much!  The period of the orbit, about 28,000 seconds, is predicted by Einstein&#8217;s equations to be shrinking by a bit more than one second per year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, pulsars are stable enough, and Hulse and Taylor&#8217;s measurements were easily accurate enough, that this change of about a second per year was relatively easy for them to measure during the ensuing decade.  And they could compare their measurements of the change in the period with the predictions of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity.  Remarkably, the agreement of the theory with the data is excellent!  For this confirmation of Einstein&#8217;s theory&#8217;s prediction of gravitational waves, Hulse and Taylor received the Nobel Prize in 1993.</p>
<div style="width: 342px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Graph showing the cumulative shift of periastron time for PSR 1913+16. This shows the decrease of the orbital period as the two stars spiral together." src="https://i0.wp.com/www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/resources/hulse_taylor.jpg" alt="Graph showing the cumulative shift of periastron time for PSR 1913+16. This shows the decrease of the orbital period as the two stars spiral together." width="332" height="307" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hulse and Taylor&#8217;s data (black dots) for the reduction in the period of the neutron stars&#8217; orbit compared to Einstein&#8217;s theory&#8217;s prediction (solid line) of how the orbit should change due to the emission of gravitational waves. (General Relativity is the name of Einstein&#8217;s Theory of gravity.) Notice how remarkably precise is the agreement over decades!</p></div>
<p>Hulse and Taylor had thus observed the effect of gravitational waves for the first time in human history. But they hadn&#8217;t observed the waves themselves; they&#8217;d observed <strong>the loss of energy</strong>, in the neutron star pair, <strong>due</strong> to the waves, but not the waving of space, compressing and expanding as the waves move by. Clearly, this detection of gravitational waves was <strong>indirect</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A Future, Likely <span style="color:#008000;">Direct</span> Detection of Gravitational Waves</strong></p>
<p>A direct search for gravitational waves is underway now, at experiments known as <a href="http://www.ligo-la.caltech.edu/LLO/overviewsci.htm" target="_blank">LIGO</a> and <a href="http://www.ego-gw.it/public/about/whatis.aspx" target="_blank">VIRGO</a>.  When a gravitational wave passes by the Earth, space itself grows and shrinks a little bit, and the distances between objects increases and decreases.  It&#8217;s an incredibly tiny effect even for powerful gravitational waves; you and I would never notice it.  But this shrinking and growing of space can potentially be observed with extremely stable, carefully designed lasers looking for the distance between two mirrors to shift by less than the radius of a <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">proton</a>, which itself is 100,000 times smaller than the radius of an <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">atom</a>!  <em>[The principles involved are not so different from those used in the famous <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/mmhist.html" target="_blank">Michelson-Morley experiment</a> &#8212; but the experimental requirements are vastly greater!]</em></p>
<p>When the repeated changing of the distance between mirrors due to a stretching and compression of space is actually observed, that will clearly be <strong>direct</strong> observation of waves of space itself &#8212; gravitational waves.  This hasn&#8217;t happened yet, but the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; phase of LIGO is coming up very soon, starting this year.  We may well see LIGO make discoveries within the decade.</p>
<p><strong>BICEP2: <span style="color:#ff6600;">Direct or Indirect</span>?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s very clear that BICEP2 &#8212; <em>IF the experiment&#8217;s results are correct (they have not been confirmed by another experiment yet) and IF they are correctly interpreted as due to gravitational waves (which is still an open question)</em> &#8212;represents an advance over the Hulse-Taylor discovery.  But it&#8217;s not as direct as LIGO, either.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s measurement [<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">see here for some details</a>]  is actually of the polarization of light  that was released 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began, at the time when the universe cooled enough to become transparent. This light has now become the &#8220;cosmic microwave background&#8221; [CMB] which we observe today coming from all directions in the sky.  So really they&#8217;re directly observing light (microwaves rather than visible light), not waves in space itself &#8212; gravitational waves.</p>
<p>But the nature and size of the polarization effect they observe (&#8220;B-mode&#8221; polarization, across large swathes of sky) is believed to have only one possible source: gravitational waves, created in the early universe and ringing for 380,000 years, and then interacting with the light that is now the CMB.  It is the squeezing and stretching of space within which the light is moving that causes the light to end up polarized in a unique way.</p>
<p>In this sense, you could say that the CMB is providing a sort of unusual photograph of gravitational waves, taken at 380,000 years post-Big-Bang.  It gives far, far more detail about their nature than does the Hulse-Taylor measurement; it confirms more and different things that Einstein predicted, such as the fact that these gravitational waves have &#8220;spin two&#8221;, which is necessary for them to give B-mode polarization.  If you think of it as a photograph, BICEP2&#8217;s measurement seems pretty direct.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it&#8217;s nowhere near as direct as LIGO would be, where mirrors that humans have set up will actually move back and forth as a gravitational wave&#8217;s crests and troughs pass by.  Far, far more detail will be available when that happens &#8212; and there will be little or no ambiguity about the interpretation of the data.  For BICEP2, it&#8217;s still conceivable (though no one has thought of anything specific) that the B-mode polarization actually is not due to gravitational waves but is due to something else.  The very fact that this is conceivable &#8212; that maybe the polarization comes from something other than waves in space itself &#8212; reflects the fact that the BICEP2 data involves looking at something that happened billions of years ago in very distant locations, and drawing inferences.  BICEP2 isn&#8217;t itself seeing space shrink and expand; it&#8217;s observing polarized light created long ago, and then scientists are inferring that the pattern of its polarization is due to space shrinking and expanding. From that point of view, BICEP2&#8217;s detection is still rather indirect.</p>
<p>So call it what you will, it&#8217;s clearly (if correct and correctly interpreted) more direct than Hulse and Taylor&#8217;s measurement, and less direct than a detection at LIGO would be.  Maybe we should call it &#8220;(&#8230;nnnn)direct&#8221;?  In any case, what we call it isn&#8217;t important; what&#8217;s important is to figure out whether it&#8217;s correct, and what it means.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Familiar throughout our international culture, the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; is well-known as the theory that scientists use to describe and explain the history of the universe. But the theory is not a single conceptual unit, and there are parts that are more reliable than others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that the theory &#8212; a set of equations describing how the universe <em>(more precisely, the <strong><em>observable patch</em></strong> of our universe, which may be a tiny fraction of the universe)</em> changes over time, and leading to sometimes precise predictions for what should, if the theory is right, be observed by humans in the sky &#8212; actually consists of different periods, some of which are far more speculative than others.  In the more speculative early periods, we must use equations in which we have limited confidence at best; moreover, data relevant to these periods, from observations of the cosmos and from particle physics experiments, is slim to none. In more recent periods, our confidence is very, very strong.</p>
<p>In my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">&#8220;History of the Universe&#8221; article</a> <em>[see also my related articles on <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>, on the <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot Big Bang</a>, and on the <a title="Before Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/before-inflation/" target="_blank">pre-inflation period</a>; also a comment that <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">the Big Bang is an expansion, <strong>not</strong> an explosion!</a>]</em>, the following figure appears, though without the colored zones, which I&#8217;ve added for this post. The colored zones emphasize what we know, what we suspect, and what we don&#8217;t know at all.</p>

<p>Notice that in the figure, I don&#8217;t measure time from the start of the universe.  That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t <em>know</em> how or when the universe started (and in particular, the notion that <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">it started from a singularity</a>, or worse, <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">an exploding &#8220;cosmic egg&#8221;</a>, is simply an over-extrapolation to the past and a misunderstanding of what the theory actually says.) Instead I measure time from the start of the <strong>Hot</strong> Big Bang in the observable patch of the universe.  <em>I also don&#8217;t even know precisely when the Hot Big Bang started, but the uncertainty on that initial time (relative to other events) is less than one second &#8212; so all the times I&#8217;ll mention, which are much longer than that, aren&#8217;t affected by this uncertainty.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll now take you through the different confidence zones of the Big Bang, from the latest to the earliest, as indicated in the figure above.</p>
<p><span id="more-7537"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Green Zone: Confidence</strong></p>
<p>A key clue that the observable patch of the universe was once hot and dense, and cooling as it expanded &#8212; i.e. that there <em>was</em> a Hot Big Bang period (preceded perhaps by cosmic inflation, but we don&#8217;t need to focus on that yet) &#8212; is the presence in the universe of the cosmic microwave background [CMB]. From all parts of the sky, an easily detectable sea of electromagnetic radiation in the form of microwaves (photons with energy about 1000 times less than photons of visible light) is streaming across the universe, and onto the Earth. Not only is the CMB a broad clue as to the universe&#8217;s past, it is also a key tool for scientists to use in finding even more precise and focused clues. Much of the history of the observable patch is imprinted in the details of the CMB.</p>
<p>A prediction of the Hot Big Bang is that the microwaves are just a sign of past heat, and of nothing else. Specifically, if you measure the microwave photons&#8217; energy, and plot <em>the amount of energy</em> coming from a patch of sky due to photons <em>of a particular frequency</em>, you should see the same plot (a &#8220;black-body spectrum&#8221;, as it is called) as you would see for photons emitted by a cold piece of ice or rock or metal.  [Yes, ice at 2.7 degrees C above <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> does glow in microwaves.]  The fact that the COBE satellite&#8217;s data agrees closely with the prediction of a black-body spectrum (shown in the figure) is overwhelming evidence that there was a Hot Big Bang going on at the time that atoms first formed, when the observable patch of the universe became transparent to light &#8212; a time now believed to be about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began.</p>

Data from the COBE satellite is the red crosses; the green curve is the prediction of a black-body spectrum.</p></div>
<p>The most powerful evidence that a simple view of the Hot Big Bang is correct even earlier is the success of the theory (i.e. equations) for nucleosynthesis: the formation of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> for the lightest atoms during the Hot Big Bang.  <em>(Note the atoms themselves formed hundreds of thousands of years later, when the temperature was cool enough for <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">the nuclei to capture electrons</a>.)</em>  The equations of the Hot Big Bang include</p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein&#8217;s version of gravity and</li>
<li>the &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; used to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and non-gravitational forces.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These equations can be used to calculate how abundant certain light atoms should be, if there was a Hot Big Bang.  Specifically, one can compute the ratios of how much hydrogen <em>(normal <strong>and</strong> heavy [&#8220;deuterium&#8221;])</em>, helium <em>(normal [&#8220;helium-4&#8221;] <strong>and</strong> light [&#8220;helium-3&#8221;])</em>, and lithium should be present in pristine parts of the observable patch, if the atomic nuclei of those elements were mainly forged during the cooling stages of the Hot Big Bang. If the elements other than hydrogen were only formed in stars, then there should be very little helium and virtually no deuterium in the observable patch of the universe. (Deuterium is actually destroyed in stars.) But in a cooling Hot Big Bang, a lot of helium &#8212; about 1/4 of the amount of hydrogen &#8212; and a small but measurable amount of deuterium should be produced.</p>
<p>These predictions of the Hot Big Bang depend in great detail on our understanding of particle physics and gravity &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">of the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force (in Einstein&#8217;s version of it) and on the properties of neutrinos, electrons, photons, protons and neutrons.</a> And the numbers work! The amount of helium, relative to ordinary hydrogen, is predicted to be in the 20 &#8211; 25% range; deuterium is predicted to be in the range of one part in 10,000 to 100,000, helium-3 a factor of 10 smaller than that, and lithium in the part per 10 billion range. The data agree!</p>

<p>That these predictions agree with observations of the distant cosmos (see the figure below) provides a strong argument that the Hot Big Bang really occurred, and was originally hot enough to break apart nuclei.  That means that temperatures were initially at least hot enough that the typical particle had an energy of about 0.001 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, which would have happened a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang began.  More precise measurements even help us understand how much ordinary matter there is in the observable patch of the universe, with results that agree with other measurements of the same quantity.</p>
<p>For this reason, I&#8217;ve marked the nucleosynthesis period and what follows it in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>, to emphasize that we have strong observational evidence that the Hot Big Bang did occur, and was so hot &#8212; hot enough to destroy atomic nuclei &#8212; that the atomic nuclei around us today had to form from scratch as the temperature cooled.</p>

<p>However, for times before nucleosynthesis, the arguments are weaker. We don&#8217;t have much direct evidence for what was taking place. But we have a lot of knowledge about particle physics, up to energies of a few hundred GeV, thanks to the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] and its predecessors over the last few decades.  So if we assume that the Hot Big Bang started at temperatures so high that a typical particle would have had an energy of a few hundred <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, we can calculate the observable patch&#8217;s properties from that temperature downward. At such a high temperature,</p>

<li>the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field would have been &#8220;off&#8221;</a>, so <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">many particles would not have had their usual masses</a>; and</li>
<li>also, separately, quarks and gluons would have been free to roam.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the temperature cooled, we can calculate <em>(now that <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">we know the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass</a>, and if we assume there aren&#8217;t any lightweight particles that we don&#8217;t know about)</em> that first the Higgs field would have turned &#8220;on&#8221;, making the weak nuclear force henceforth weak; and then, a bit later, the strong nuclear force would have become very strong, so that quarks and gluons and anti-quarks would have been trapped henceforth and forever into <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a>, anti-protons and anti-neutrons, as well as other very short-lived <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>.</p>
<p>However, we can&#8217;t yet directly confirm <em>by cosmological observation</em> that this is true.  It&#8217;s not entirely impossible that there was something odd and unknown about the universe that makes some of these conclusions premature. Someday we may be able to be more certain, but not yet. So in this time period, starting just before the Higgs field turns on and going until nucleosynthesis, we have a highly educated guess as to what was happening, though no direct experimental checks.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve marked this time period in <span style="color:#333333;">yellow</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Orange Zone: What Started the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hot</span> Big Bang?</strong></p>
<p>Even earlier? Well, at even higher temperatures we don&#8217;t know the particle physics with confidence; we&#8217;d need particle accelerators more powerful than the LHC.  To figure out what happened in the Big Bang in detail, we have to make assumptions about the particles available, without any way to check them. But still, we are not without information, because we do have an experimental probe: the CMB itself.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the CMB is incredibly uniform, to one part in 100,000. That&#8217;s already information, and explaining why it&#8217;s true is one of the arguments in favor of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s much, much more information in the <em>imperfections</em> in that uniformity. The non-uniformities, which were discovered by the COBE satellite, have been studied in detail by the WMAP and Planck satellites, along with many other experiments from the ground. And it was in studying the non-uniformities in the CMB and their tiny bit of polarization that BICEP2 made <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the big (but <del>unconfirmed</del> now discredited) discovery that was announced last week</a> (here&#8217;s some <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">background information on that discovery, in the form of FAQs, that you may find useful</a>).</p>
<p>The photons in the CMB are astonishingly sensitive. There are very few things that affect them, and fortunately, most of the things that do are relics from the extremely early periods of the observable patch of the universe. It&#8217;s an unexpected gift for scientists that this is true! The CMB photons were created about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang, and yet they give us insight into the entire period before that, all the way back to a period <em>just before</em> the Hot Big Bang!!!  (They also can give us important insights into what happened <em>after</em> 380,000 years, too.)  To me, this incredibly sensitivity of the CMB is one of the most amazing natural phenomena in all of science&#8230; and it has been the key to progress in cosmology in recent years.</p>
<p>Detailed measurements of the CMB have increasingly given us insight into the zone marked in orange, where we don&#8217;t have any particle physics data &#8212; just guesses, and calculations based on those guesses.  The reason insights have been possible is that our calculations rely on very general properties of the Hot Big Bang and the pre-Hot Big Bang period to make predictions.  What I mean by this is that these calculations begin with very simple assumptions about the patterns of non-uniformities that were present at the start of the Hot Big Bang, and then we check if these assumptions give predictions for non-uniformities in the CMB that agree with data.  They do!  This is shown in the figure below, where predictions of the Hot Big Bang theory, <em>with these simple assumptions about the starting point</em>, are compared with data from the Planck satellite. (Similar but less precise measurements were made before Planck, by WMAP and a number of ground-based experiments.)</p>

<p>Thus, simple assumptions about the non-uniformities at the start of the Hot Big Bang seem to be right, more or less.  This lends support to the hypothesis of cosmic inflation, which can produce simple non-uniformities. But it&#8217;s not convincing, because one can imagine simple non-uniformities arising in some other way.  There is at least one alternative &#8212; the ekpyrotic universe &#8212; that is also largely consistent with this data, and there might have been others that no one has thought of.  Meanwhile, there were many qualitatively different forms that cosmic inflation might take, some of which could have been consistent with universes quite different from those with a simple Big Bang.  For example, the data has been consistent with universes that, at temperatures a bit higher than reached in the yellow zone in the figure, have more spatial dimensions than the three we&#8217;re used to. So the number of possible options in the orange zone has been very large, and the degree of speculation involved has been very high.</p>

<p>This <del>may have changed</del> with <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/">BICEP2s new measurement,</a> which <del>gives</del> unfortunately did not give powerful new evidence for cosmic inflation through inflation&#8217;s generation of gravitational waves&#8230; assuming the measurement itself, and the interpretation of the measurement, both hold up over time.  <em>[The interpretation did not.]</em> Since a measurable amount of gravitational waves can only be produced, as far as we know, if a period of inflation occurred and was <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">driven by a <strong>very</strong> large amount of &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8220;</a>, BICEP2&#8217;s result may rule out all known alternatives to inflation, and significantly narrow down the options for how inflation may have occurred, excluding many of the more radical options as well as many simple ones. As such, it may increase confidence in the inflation hypothesis to change the color of the orange zone to yellow, or even, as more measurements come in and become more precise, to green.  <em>[But it did not.]</em></p>
<p>However, let&#8217;s not jump to conclusions until the measurement is confirmed with more data and by other observing teams.  <em>[You see how important it is that I write these cautionary caveats in my articles.  I have seen many measurements come and go; the fraction that stick is much less than half.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Red Zone: Scientific Guesswork</strong></p>
<p>But BICEP2 can really only tell us about <strong><em>the late stage and exit from inflation</em></strong>. If we go deep into the inflationary period and try to go earlier, into the red zone in the figure, we face two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don&#8217;t have any experimental probes of this early time, and</li>
<li>we don&#8217;t know which particle physics and/or gravity equations we should be using.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not yet have any cosmological observations that access this time period; the CMB photons bring us back to the late stage of inflation, but not further. We cannot infer much yet from CMB measurements about the &#8220;inflaton&#8221; field (and its particle) that is supposed to play the dominant particle-physics role during inflation, and we have no idea what other types of fields it may interact with, so it is hard to be sure what type of process got inflation started. Meanwhile, theoretical physics doesn&#8217;t help much either. We can try assuming that string theory is the true theory of quantum gravity in our world, but if we do that, we still find the equations are hard to solve and give, at best, a variety of possibilities. And trying to work in greater generality, without assuming string theory, doesn&#8217;t help; the calculations are still ambiguous and difficult. This doesn&#8217;t stop theoretical physicists from making educated, scientific guesses &#8212; i.e., speculations backed with concrete equations and calculations. But until we get some data that allows us to distinguish the many possibilities, we can&#8217;t say for sure what was actually happening back then.</p>
<p>So if people tells you that the universe <em>started</em> in such and such a way, perhaps &#8220;<a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">with a singularity</a>&#8221; or &#8220;with a quantum fluctuation out of nothing&#8221; or &#8220;in the Big Crunch (i.e. the collapse) of a previous phase of the universe&#8221;, remember that they&#8217;re telling you about the <span style="color:#ff0000;">red zone</span>. They&#8217;re neglecting to tell you that what they&#8217;re saying is pure theory, with neither an experiment to back it up nor a clear theoretical reason to believe their suggestion is unique and preferable over someone else&#8217;s alternative. Only a bit later in cosmic history, once we focus on the late stages of inflation, and forward in time from there to nucleosynthesis, do we have both data (cosmological observation and particle physics collisions) and reasonably reliable theory (Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity plus the Standard Model of particle physics). Our confidence grows as time moves forward, the observable patch of the universe cools, and physics becomes of a sort that we&#8217;ve tested in numerous experiments already.</p>
<p>From this, I hope that you can see that the Big Bang Theory really isn&#8217;t a single, undifferentiated structure.  The most reliable part of the theory is that there was, at one point, a <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot stage of the Big Bang</a>. (Some people call that the Big Bang, in fact.) If BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is accurate, and correctly interpreted, then the reliable portion of the theory may then include a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation that preceded</a> the Hot Big Bang. (Some people would call &#8220;inflation plus the Hot Big Bang&#8221; the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;.) But anything before inflation is not in the least reliable&#8230; in particular, the notion that the universe&#8217;s heat and density increased <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">to the extent that Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity, presumably indicating that they&#8217;re not sufficient to describe what was going on, is an <em>assumption</em></a>. So that part of the Big Bang Theory may not survive the test of time. You should be prepared, as scientists are, to let it go.  After all, from 1960-1980 people had a vision of the early Big Bang that didn&#8217;t include something like inflation; their version was significantly adjusted as knowledge was gained, so why shouldn&#8217;t ours be?</p>
<p>Moreover, it is quite possible that the start of the universe, which people often refer to as the ultimate Big Bang, may not have had anything &#8220;Bang-ish&#8221; or even Big about it.  Yes, we might even need to let go someday of the idea that the universe truly <em>began</em> with a Big Bang. The scientific community won&#8217;t have any problem with this, because many of us have never taken that idea very seriously in the first place.  But what about the rest of our society, which seems to hold to this name and notion far harder than do scientists themselves, to the point of <em>(egad!)</em> naming a television show after it?!  The loss may be more shocking than necessary&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did the universe begin with a singularity?  A point in space and/or a moment in time where everything in the universe was crushed together, infinitely hot and infinitely densely packed?</p>
<p><strong><em>Doesn&#8217;t the Big Bang Theory say so?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, let me ask you a question. Did <strong>you</strong> begin with a singularity?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see. Some decades ago, you were smaller. And then before that, you were even smaller. At some point you could fit inside your mother&#8217;s body, and if we follow time backwards, you were even much smaller than that.</p>
<p>If we follow your growth curve back, it would be very natural &#8212; if we didn&#8217;t know anything about biology, cells, and human reproduction &#8212; to assume that initially you were infinitesimally small&#8230; that you were created from a single point!</p>
<p>But that would be wrong. The mistake is obvious &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t make sense to assume that the period of rapid growth that you went through as a tiny embryo was the simple continuation of a process that extends on and on into the past, back until you were infinitely small.  Instead, there was a point where something changed&#8230; the growth began not from a point but from a single object of definite size: a fertilized egg.</p>
<p>The notion that the Universe <em>started</em> with a Big Bang, and that this Big Bang <em>started</em> from a singularity &#8212; a point in space and/or a moment in time where the universe was infinitely hot and dense &#8212; is not that different, really, from assuming humans begin their lives as infinitely small eggs. It&#8217;s about over-extrapolating into the past.<span id="more-7526"></span></p>
<p>The connection with some kind of singularity dates back to the original Big Bang idea, the one which precedes the notion of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that&#8217;s been in the news over the past few days.  <em>[Here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">an FAQ</a> for non-experts about the news; <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the news</a> itself; and <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">what the news might mean if it holds up</a>.]</em>  The part of the universe that we can see with our eyes and telescopes is the &#8220;observable patch&#8221; of the universe; it is probably far smaller than the whole universe <em>(or, if it&#8217;s sufficiently complicated, &#8220;the multiverse&#8221;).</em>  What we know from interpreting various observations of the cosmos is that</p>
<ul>
<li>today the observable patch is cold and diffuse and expanding</li>
<li>once upon a time, billions of years ago, the observable patch was hot and dense</li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent that we trust Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity, we can use those equations to understand how the Universe might have had this present and that past.  People studying those equations (Friedmann, LeMaître, Robertson and Walker) learned that a universe can go through a process of expanding, cooling and diffusing &#8212; and thus could proceed from <span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>a hot, dense, rapidly expanding past</strong></span> to <span style="color:#000080;">a <strong><span style="color:#00ccff;"><em>cool, diffuse and slowly expanding present</em></span></strong></span>. This process is what we think our observable patch (and probably a larger region in which it is contained) has been doing for almost all of its 13.7 billion year history.</p>
<p>But suppose, seeing this behavior, we use these equations try to follow time <em>backwards</em> &#8212; just as we tried to infer the past of an embryo. We find our equations suggest a universe in which the further you go back, the hotter it was, the more dense, and the more rapidly it was expanding. If you keep going back and back, then <em>(in the Old Big Bang model, before we knew about inflation)</em> you find that at a sufficiently early time, 13.7 billion years ago, the density, temperature and expansion rate start off as <strong>infinite</strong>. That&#8217;s a <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>singularity!</em></span></p>
<p>But would you have a reason to believe in that singularity?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked over the years with many experts in &#8220;quantum gravity&#8221; <em>[the poorly understood but required blend of Einstein&#8217;s gravity and quantum physics, a blend that will be needed to explain extreme gravitational phenomena]</em> and I&#8217;ve never spoken to one who  believed that the universe began with a real singularity. Why? Because</p>
<ul>
<li>the singularity arises from using Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity</li>
<li>but we know Einstein&#8217;s equations aren&#8217;t <em>sufficient</em> &#8212; they aren&#8217;t able to describe certain extreme gravitational phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, when the density and heat become extremely large, quantum physics of gravity becomes important. <em>But Einstein&#8217;s equations ignore all these quantum effects.</em> So we already know that <strong><em>in certain extreme conditions, Einstein&#8217;s equations simply don&#8217;t apply</em></strong>. How could we then use those very same equations to conclude there&#8217;s a singularity at the beginning of the universe?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And if we don&#8217;t know how to alter Einstein&#8217;s gravity equations to make them into quantum gravity equations, then &#8212; well, we don&#8217;t know what happens <em>instead</em> of a singularity.</p>
<p>Now that was where things stood before inflation was known. Inflation changes the details of the <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">history of the universe</a> quite a lot. But it doesn&#8217;t change the basic conclusion about singularities: we don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t yet know what happened at the earliest moments of the universe, because we have neither data nor sufficiently clear equations to help us answer basic questions about it.  Related to this, we don&#8217;t know precisely how inflation started (or even <em>could</em> have started) in the first place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making this up out of my head.  Just yesterday I was involved in a long conversation with professors and post-doctoral researchers at Harvard, in which we discussed various exotic mathematical methods for exploring the inflationary epoch and the era before it. The possibility that there really is a singularity at the beginning of the universe never came up once.</p>
<p>Or you can look at papers by the world&#8217;s experts &#8212; say, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0702178" target="_blank">one by Alan Guth, a 17-page review</a> of &#8220;eternal&#8221; inflation (i.e. inflation that continues, at least somewhere in our very large universe, into the infinite future) &#8212; and although he devotes some pages to the issue of what might have preceded inflation, the word &#8220;singularity&#8221; does not appear anywhere in his text.</p>
<p>Or look at the figure below, taken from page 6 of <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/lectures/Biermann_07/LindeLecturesMunich1.pdf" target="_blank">a lecture by Andrei Linde in 2007</a>, giving a schematic depiction of the history of the part of the universe that contains our observable patch.   You see that he shows it as beginning not in a singularity but in &#8220;space-time foam&#8221;. <em>[Compare his picture with the one in my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> article.]</em> What&#8217;s space-time foam? It&#8217;s space-time that is undergoing <a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">quantum fluctuations</a> &#8212; quantum jitter &#8212; in which space itself is changing its shape from moment to moment!  Well, when someone writes &#8220;space-time foam&#8221; on a graph, to physicists it means almost the same as writing &#8220;somehow quantum gravity takes care of everything&#8221;, without specifics.  (I am confident that Linde will agree that the extreme left of his figure is quite speculative.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Yet all over the media and all over the web, we can find articles, including ones published just after <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">this week&#8217;s cosmic announcement of new evidence in favor of inflation</a>, that state with great confidence that in the Big Bang Theory the universe started from a singularity. So I&#8217;m honestly very confused. <strong>Who</strong> is still telling the media and the public that the universe really started with a singularity, or that the modern Big Bang Theory says that it does? I&#8217;ve never heard an expert physicist say that. And with good reason: when singularities and other infinities have turned up in our equations in the past, those singularities disappeared when our equations, or our understanding of how to use our equations, improved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, there&#8217;s a point of logic here.  How <em>could</em> we possibly know what happened at the very beginning of the universe? No experiment can yet probe such an early time, and none of the available equations are powerful enough or usable enough to allow us to come to clear and unique conclusions.</span></p>
<p>The modern Big Bang Theory really starts <em>after</em> this period of ignorance, <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">with a burst of inflation that creates a large expanding universe, and the end of inflation which allows for the creation of the heat of the Hot Big Bang</a>.  The equations for the theory, as it currently stands, can be used to make predictions <em>even though</em> we don&#8217;t know the precise nature of our universe&#8217;s birth. Yes, a singularity often turns up in our equations when we extend them as far as they can go in the past; but a singularity of this sort is far from likely to be an aspect of nature, and instead should be interpreted as a sign of what we don&#8217;t yet understand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arguably the two greatest problems facing particle physicists, cosmologists, string theorists, and the like are both associated with an apparent failure of a notion called &#8220;naturalness&#8221;.  Until now, I&#8217;ve mostly avoided this term on this site, because to utter the word demands an extended explanation.  After all, how could nature be unnatural, <em>by definition</em>?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is that the word &#8220;natural&#8221; has multiple meanings.  The one that scientists are using in this context isn&#8217;t &#8220;having to do with nature&#8221; but rather &#8220;typical&#8221; or &#8220;as expected&#8221; or &#8220;generic&#8221;, as in, &#8220;naturally the baby started screaming when she bumped her head&#8221;, or &#8220;naturally it costs more to live near the city center&#8221;, or &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t worn those glasses in months, so naturally they were dusty.&#8221;  And unnatural is when the baby doesn&#8217;t scream, when the city center is cheap, and when the glasses are pristine. Usually, when something unnatural happens, there&#8217;s a good reason.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started writing <a title="Naturalness" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">an article about naturalness and unnaturalness</a>, and how there are two great mysteries about how unnatural our universe is, one of which lies at the heart of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>&#8216;s [LHC&#8217;s] research program.  What I&#8217;ve written so far explains what naturalness means and (in part) how it applies to the Standard Model (the equations we use to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles and forces</a>).  I&#8217;ll be extending the article to explain this in more detail, and to explain the scientific argument as to why it is <strong>so</strong> unnatural to have a <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> that is &#8220;lonely&#8221; &#8212; with no other associated particles <em>(beyond the ones we already know) </em>of roughly similar mass.  This in turn is why so many particle physicists have long expected the LHC to discover more than just a single Higgs particle and nothing else&#8230; more than just the Standard Model&#8217;s one and only missing piece&#8230; and why it will be a profound discovery with far-reaching implications if, during the next five years or so, the LHC experts sweep the floor clean and find nothing more in the LHC&#8217;s data than <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle that was found in 2012</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The big news overnight for science was the best measurement yet of the Cosmic Microwave Background [CMB], by the Planck Satellite.  The CMB consists of  microwave photons (particles of light with microwave wavelengths) that are the tell-tale leftover glow from the universe&#8217;s hot period, the Big Bang.  These photons are almost entirely uniform across the sky, and consistent with a glowing object of temperature 2.7 degrees<del> Kelvin (or Centigrade)</del><em> [poorly written]</em> above absolute zero, the temperature where everything moves as slowly as allowed by quantum mechanics.<em>  (Note added: A change of 1 degree Kelvin is the same as a change of 1 degree Centigrade, but absolute zero is 0° Kelvin and -273.15° Centigrade. Centigrade and Celsius are the same.)</em> But they aren&#8217;t quite uniform!  And those slight non-uniformities, which speak volumes about the universe, have now been read with the greatest precision ever achieved.</p>

<p>Today my chores prevent my writing a proper post, and it doesn&#8217;t help that Planck released over a dozen papers overnight&#8230; it will take a while to sift through this.  But the bullet points that everyone is talking about are<span id="more-5729"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>On small angular scales, the universe looks about as simple and as consistent with current understanding as you could ask for (or not ask for).  Many speculative notions about how the universe might have developed in its earliest stages are now out of the question. The detailed measurements of the basic properties of the universe are slightly changed, but the overall picture is evolutionary, not revolutionary.  It&#8217;s a universe with a lot of &#8220;dark energy&#8221;, a lot of dark matter, some ordinary matter including three lightweight types of neutrinos&#8230; just as we thought before.  Kind of a weird universe, but not new.</li>
<li>The idea that cosmic inflation (a period where the universe was cold and expanding at a spectacular rate, following which the hot dense period we usually think of as the classic &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; began) may have occurred, making the universe so large and uniform, is unchallenged (one might even say supported) by the data at small and medium angular scales.  Inflation could have been caused in many different ways; some of those options are now excluded or disfavored by the data.</li>
<li>Planck&#8217;s predecessor, the WMAP satellite, found that there are some funny non-uniformities, a bit larger than you&#8217;d expect, at very <em>large</em> angular scales &#8212; and Planck sees them too, confirming their existence and allowing more precise study of them.  (<del>The photons are a bit hotter</del> [NO! Careless of me!  &#8220;The temperature fluctuates more&#8221;] in half the sky than in the other half, and there&#8217;s a cold spot, and some sign of alignment of large-scale distortions that were expected to be randomly distributed.) But interpreting something like this is tricky &#8212; it could just be a statistical fluke, and since there&#8217;s only one universe, you don&#8217;t get to improve your statistics with better measurements.  (That last point is called the problem of &#8220;cosmic variance&#8221;.) So if something interesting is going on in the overall shape or structure of the universe, I suspect we&#8217;re going to need an additional and different type of measurement to convince ourselves.  And I&#8217;m not sure what that would be.

<p>Since the last point is the one that&#8217;s the most curious, I suspect it will draw most of the discussion and speculation over the next months &#8212; and certainly the headlines today.  (I also suspect the spin being put on it by the Planck collaboration &#8212; suggesting strongly that a rethink of the universe is necessary &#8212; is justified more by hope than by data.)  Meanwhile, perhaps there are more things that I missed that are hidden in those many papers&#8230;</p>

The data are fitted with a prediction using a mathematical model of the universe; the model depends on (among other things) how much dark matter and dark energy and ordinary matter are in the universe, and so by looking at which model fits the data best, Planck scientists measure these and other quantities.  The green band shows the effect of cosmic variance; we only have one universe, so at very large angular scales we can only measure a few non-uniformities, leading to large statistical uncertainties.
