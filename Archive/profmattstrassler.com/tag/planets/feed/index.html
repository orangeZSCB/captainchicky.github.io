										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still kind of exhausted from the effort (<a title="Our Survey of Exotic Decays of the Higgs is Done" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/12/19/our-survey-of-exotic-higgs-decays-is-done/" target="_blank">see yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) of completing our survey of some of the many unexpected ways that the newly discovered <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> might decay. But I would be remiss if, before heading off into the holiday break, I didn&#8217;t issue some well-deserved congratulations.</p>
<div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71757000/jpg/_71757703_020360764-1.jpg" width="299" height="217" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Jade Rabbit rover on the surface of the Moon, 15 December. Credit:Xinhua</p></div>
<p>Congratulations, first, to China &#8212; to the scientists and engineers who&#8217;ve managed to put a lander and a rover on the Moon. If you think that&#8217;s easy&#8230; think again! And they succeeded on their first attempt, a real coup. Now let&#8217;s see what science they can do with it, exploring a region of the Moon that apparently may offer answers to important questions about the Moon&#8217;s history. Specifically, by accident or by design, <a href="http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/" target="_blank">the rover is going to be able to explore an area of considerable geological importance</a>, involving one of the Moon&#8217;s giant lava flows, a relatively young one (1-2.5 billion years rather than 3 billion or more).</p>
<div style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/29/Gaia_liftoff_12_625.jpg" width="263" height="394" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Soyuz VS06, with Gaia, lifted off from Europe&#8217;s Spaceport, French Guiana, on 19 December 2013. Copyright: ESA &#8211; S. Corvaja, 2013</p></div>
<p>Congratulations, next, to the scientists and engineers of the European Union, who&#8217;ve put a fantastic telescope into space, destined to orbit the sun. The Gaia mission is aimed at doing the extraordinary: mapping, with ultra-high precision, the locations and motions of no less than 1 billion stars within our galaxy &#8212; nearly 1% of the total number. The distance to each of these stars will be determined by <a title="Parallax: Seeing in Depth" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/parallax-seeing-in-depth/" target="_blank">parallax</a> &#8212; looking at how the positions of stars wobble, from the perspective of the spacecraft as it orbits the sun &#8212; and the real motions of the stars will be determined by how they drift across the sky, and by the <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/doppler.htm" target="_blank">Doppler effect</a> for light.  This wealth of information will help scientists figure out the shape and history of the galaxy to a degree never previously possible.  Meanwhile, Gaia will also be able to do a lot of other science, picking up distant supernovas outside our galaxy, nearby asteroids orbiting our sun, and signs of planets around other stars, as well as brown dwarfs (small failed stars) that may be floating around between the stars. Gaia can even check some aspects of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity! <a href="http://sci.esa.int/gaia/28890-objectives/" target="_blank">Read here</a> about all the wonderful things this mission can do.</p>
<p>Congratulations also to the scientists and engineers in Iran, who&#8217;ve apparently moved their rocketry program, and its potential application to human space flight, among other things, another step forward. A second monkey has made the trip to the edge of space, a suborbital trip. (Did the first survive? it&#8217;s not clear, and admittedly Iran is known for photo-shopping reality into supporting the story it wants to tell. Not that it matters; <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/animals.html" target="_blank">it took the US several tries</a>, back over 60 years ago, before a monkey survived the trip, and the survival rate continued to be poor for a while. )  Anyway, it puts Iran well on its way toward its goal of a human in space by 2018.</p>
<p>And finally, congratulations to my own country, the United States, for having <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/18/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE9BF1FW20131218" target="_blank">passed a budget deal.</a> Not out of the woods yet, but at least it was bipartisan, and we&#8217;re not yet talking about <a title="Help! I’m a Hostage! (D – 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/10/help-im-a-hostage-d-7/" target="_blank">another damaging government shutdown</a>, or worse, default. Politics isn&#8217;t rocket science. We&#8217;ll have to hope our politicians can learn something from China: that it&#8217;s good to find some common and worthy goals to work toward together, rather than to fight about absolutely everything and bring the nation&#8217;s operations to a halt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a modified version of <a title="The Grand Si11iness of 11/11/11 11:11:11" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/xotica/the-grand-si11iness-of-111111-111111/">last year&#8217;s 11/11/11 article</a>, in case you missed it. </em></p>
<p>Today is a special day &#8212; at least if you are fond of the number 12, and especially so if you&#8217;re willing to buy in to one of the oldest human pseudo-scientific pursuits: numerology. Oh, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love numbers and I always have. When I was five years old I was mesmerized when my parents&#8217; car reached 99,999.9 miles, and I think 12:34:56 on 7/8/90 is just a cool a time as anybody else does. But I do this with a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it happens that a few influential people attempt serious and consequential numerology involving the calendar &#8212; predicting disaster and convincing people to sell their homes and give away their belongings. Now that makes me mad. Outraged, in fact &#8212; because it&#8217;s often obvious from the way these predictions are generated that those who made them don&#8217;t understand much about the calendar, about time, about history and about astronomy or physics&#8230; and yet they speak with authority, an authority they haven&#8217;t earned and don&#8217;t deserve.</p>
<p>So as we celebrate this one-two-of-a-kind moment, let&#8217;s also remember, and enjoy, just how absurd it really is. Let us even count the ways.<span id="more-5154"></span></p>
<p><strong>Cycles and Compromise</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at our string of twelves: we are 12 years after the year 2000; 12 months and 12 days after the start of the year; 12 hours, 12 minutes and 12 seconds since midnight.</p>
<p>Each of the first three 12&#8217;s has something to do with astronomy &#8212; but if we look closely, something&#8217;s a little off.</p>
<p>First we need to count years, and a year is the time it takes the earth to orbit the sun. Almost. Not quite. An <strong>astronomical year</strong> is the time it takes the earth to orbit the sun. A <strong>calendar year</strong>? that&#8217;s something else.</p>
<p>Then we need to count months. A month, of course, is roughly a &#8220;moon&#8221;, the time between two full moons &#8230; and a full moon occurs at the moment that the sun is on one side of the earth and the moon is on the exact other side. In some calendars around the world and throughout history, a month is a moon &#8212; <em>but not in ours.</em></p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the day: the time it takes for the sun to go from overhead to setting and rising and back to overhead again.</p>
<p>The problem with all of these astronomical cycles is that they are not synchronized; there&#8217;s no reason why they should be, since they are separate accidents of nature. The number of moons in an astronomical year isn&#8217;t a nice number; nor is the number of days in an astronomical year, or in a moon.</p>
<p>The number of days in an astronomical year is close to 365 and a quarter, not 365 or 366. That&#8217;s why at some point it was decided<em> (by whom? and when? and on whose authority? it turns out our democratic society keeps track of its dates under the decree of a Roman emperor)</em> that we would have three years in a row of 365 days, and then a fourth year of 366 years &#8212; a &#8220;leap&#8221; year. That way, the number of days in four calendar years is just about 1461, which is just about four astronomical years. But even this isn&#8217;t exactly right, so thanks to Pope Gregory, 3 of every 400 years (most recently the years 1700, 1800, and 1900, but not 2000) we skip a leap year, to get back on track, and keep the astronomical and calendar years lined up. More or less. It&#8217;s still not perfect.</p>
<p>Of course this way of doing things is completely arbitrary! We could just as well have 19 years of 365 days, and then in the 20th year have an extra five days. Or we could go 99 years of 365 days, with an extra month of 25 days at the turn of the century. Indeed some calendar systems around the world do something just like that. If we&#8217;d decided to do either of those things, there wouldn&#8217;t have been a leap year in 2004 or 2008, and today wouldn&#8217;t be 12/12 at all! It would be 12/14.</p>
<p>Or if Pope Gregory had removed three leap years at the start of each 400 year cycle, eliminating them in 2000, 2004 and 2008 instead of in 2100, 2200 and 2300, again it would not be 12/12 today. And so forth.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s celebrate 12/12 &#8212; an accident of the leap year decisions of a Roman emperor and a Roman pope.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve hardly begun. Let&#8217;s talk about those months. The number of days in a moon is about 29 and a half, so a moon is neither 29 nor 30 days, which is sort of inconvenient. And worse, it also doesn&#8217;t divide 365 (or 366) very conveniently; a year is quite a bit more than 12 moons and quite a bit less than 13. So how did we end up with 12 months of 30 or 31 days (except for February)? Well, you can blame the Roman emperors for that too: we&#8217;ve inherited our calendar mainly from Julius Caesar (who got a month named after himself &#8212; a long one with 31 days) with adjustments by Augustus (who had the following month named after himself and made sure it too was one with 31 days). And so the days per month are all funny. Why not, you might ask, have 12 months alternating between 29 days and 30 days, and 1 extra mini-month of 11 days?</p>
<p>Or why not have the last month of the year be the short one, making February a month of 30 days and December a month of 29, instead of our current odd arrangement? That would be more sensible &#8212; and if we did that, then today would be 12/11, not 12/12.</p>
<p>Or how about this? What about 13 months of 28 days each, with the last month being 29? That&#8217;s 365 days. Wouldn&#8217;t that be simpler? Each month would be four weeks, with just one extra day tacked on at the end of the year. No muss, no fuss, no having to remember which months have 30 days and which have 31. Ah, but that would mean 13 (ooooooooo! scary!) months&#8230; which we all know would be terrible. (And today would be 13/11, not 12/12.)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s celebrate 12/12 &#8212; an accident of how a Roman military dictator chose the days of our calendar&#8217;s months, and perhaps also a consequence of the fear of the number 13.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get back to years, months and days in a minute and a second, but first let&#8217;s talk about 12:12:12 as a time.</p>
<p><strong>An Ancient Obsession with Twelve</strong></p>
<p>How did we end up dividing our day into 24 hours, each of which has 60 minutes, each of which has 60 seconds? Well, not everybody has counted on their ten fingers the way we do; some have counted <em>the joints on their fingers</em> (not including the thumb), of which we have 3 × 4 = 12 on each hand. Probably some have counted in other ways, but the fact that 12 was a special number for the Sumerians, Babylonians and Egyptians has resulted (through what appears to be a rather torturous history that I don&#8217;t claim to understand at all) in our having 12 hours for daytime and 12 for night, with 60 (which is 12 times 5) being the number of minutes in an hour and the number of seconds in a minute.</p>
<p>Our western culture does not share this obsession with 12. Our obsessions are with 10, and indeed that&#8217;s why Europeans worked to convince most of the world (except for the stubborn United States) to go over to a metric system, which is all based on 10s, 100s, 1000s, etc., in analogy to the way we in Europe and its former colonies (and many other human cultures) count. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, 100 centimeters in a meter, 10 millimeters in a centimeter, and so forth. So how did we avoid ending up with a metric <strong>clock</strong>, and find ourselves stuck with timekeeping that harkens back to numerical preferences over 4000 years old?</p>
<p>The French actually tried a metric clock after their revolution, and indeed it would have worked rather well. With 24 hours, 60 minutes and 60 seconds, our day has a total of 86,400 seconds and 1440 minutes. If instead we made the second just about 15 percent shorter and the minute just about 15 percent longer, we could have 100,000 seconds per day, organized as 10 hours of 100 minutes, each with 100 seconds. Now wouldn&#8217;t that make more sense? No more having to figure out that a 140 minute movie is two hours and twenty minutes. No more making that silly mistake that we&#8217;ve all made, forgetting that 1 minute and 30 seconds is shorter than 100 seconds. Noon occurs at 5:00, Midnight at 10:00. All very simple.</p>
<p>Sadly, with that arrangement, no time during the day would be 12:12:12. So much for that. You&#8217;d have to reserve your excitement for 9:99:99. (Which actually sounds just as exciting to me &#8212; the last second before midnight.)</p>
<p>Of course we&#8217;d have to give up many other things. Those beautiful European clock towers would become anachronistic (pardon the pun.) No more &#8220;eleventh-hour solutions,&#8221; or &#8220;clock striking twelve&#8221; either. And we&#8217;d have to get used to the fact that a quarter of an hour &#8212; 0.25 hours &#8212; would be a sensible 25 minutes, not 15. Well, it&#8217;s certainly a little late for this change, reasonable as it would have been; we should have done it before the digital age.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s enjoy 12:12:12 by honoring the Sumerians and Babylonians who made it all possible, and celebrating those who successfully defeated the French Revolution and prevented the metric system from taking over timekeeping.</p>
<p>By the way, this raises another issue: how we get &#8217;12 from 2012. It happens we count years by 10s. 2012 is two thousand plus zero hundred plus ten plus two years. And when we write the year using two digits, we just strip off the &#8220;20&#8221;. But of course that&#8217;s arbitrary: we don&#8217;t count hours, minutes or seconds by 10s, and we don&#8217;t write the 1012th minute of the day by stripping off the 10. Instead, the 1012th minute of the day is what we call 4:52 in the afternoon, or 16:52 on a 24-hour clock. And we could have done the same thing with years: we could count 60 years as a cycle, and then 2012 would be the 32st year in the 34th cycle, which would then make today more naturally 12/12/32. In fact, that&#8217;s exactly what the Chinese do. However, their calendar doesn&#8217;t share our year 1; their last 60 year cycle started in 1984, so they refer to this year not as &#8217;12 or &#8217;32, but as &#8217;29.</p>
<p><strong>The Arbitrary Starting Points</strong></p>
<p>And why is it 2012 anyway? That&#8217;s 2012 years from when? Of course it is from when the Christian (or &#8220;Common&#8221;) Era began, ostensibly from the year of the date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth. But Jesus was born during or just after the reign of Herod the Great (so say two of the Gospels rather clearly). Herod is well-known from other non-religious historical sources, too. These sources also have dates, and it is clear, comparing them, that Herod died in what we now call 4 B.C. In other words, our calendar is <em>wrong</em>; it starts at the wrong year. (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9693576/Jesus-was-born-years-earlier-than-thought-claims-Pope.html" target="_blank">Even the Pope agrees, now.</a>) The original estimate of when to set the year 1, made around the year 525, was simply mistaken; the historical knowledge available back then was not sufficient to make a correct estimate. And we can&#8217;t precisely fix the mistake now, because even today the historical data doesn&#8217;t make it clear <em>exactly</em> which year is the right one. So. Is it 2012? Or 2016? Or 2017? Or 2018?</p>
<p>Of course there are other cultures out there who might not agree that it is anywhere close to 2012. The Jewish calendar says it is 5773. The Chinese calendar says it is 4710. There are Buddhist calendars used in large portions of Asia that put the year at 2556; in Tibet the year is 2139. From the astronomical or the philosophical point of view, the setting of year 1 is arbitrary, and throughout human history there have been many calendars setting the starting year in different ways.</p>
<p>Ok, that&#8217;s one 12 down; now what about the fact that December is the 12th month? Hmm. &#8220;December.&#8221; What does that mean? Well, let&#8217;s see. September, October, November, December&#8230; oh, right! Seventh-month, Eight-month, Ninth-month, Tenth-month&#8230; wait a second! How did December end up with this name when it is the 12th month in our calendar?</p>
<p>Well, go back to early Roman republican times, and you&#8217;ll find December was the tenth month &#8212; the year started in the spring, in March. There was a change made for political convenience during the Roman republic, back in what we now call 153 B.C.E. (of course they didn&#8217;t call it that), putting January at the start of the year. Were it not for this change, today would be 10/12, and we&#8217;d be waiting til February, then the twelfth month (which is why it is the short month!) to celebrate today&#8217;s numerical excitement.</p>
<p>Then there is still a question of which <em>day</em> is to be denoted the first of the year: the first day of the first month. Why is the first day of January the day when we start the year? It&#8217;s not the solstice (December 21st or 22nd typically) &#8212; the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere and the longest in the southern &#8212; which would seem to be a natural day on which to mark the beginning of the year. And it&#8217;s not the equinox, the start of spring in the northern hemisphere, when day and night are of equal length across the globe. It&#8217;s a completely arbitrary day, and the position of the earth in its orbit on what we call January 1st has even shifted as adjustments have been made to our calendar. If we had put the start of the year on the solstice, but kept the months laid out the same way, we&#8217;d be at 12/23 by now, not 12/12.</p>
<p>Indeed, the arbitrariness of the date has been noticed before. For many centuries, different parts of Europe celebrated the new year on various days other than January 1st. And today many other cultures around the world start the year on another day. The Chinese start the year toward the end of February; for them we are not in the 12th month yet. The Jewish calendar has its New Year sometime in September; we&#8217;re not even into the 4th month. And so on. In short, there&#8217;s nothing intrinsically special about starting the year where we do, and so only for societies using Pope Gregory&#8217;s calendar (a minority of the world&#8217;s population) is today the twelfth day of the twelfth month.</p>
<p>So a toast to the Roman republic, without which we&#8217;d be in the wrong month. And also to Pope Gregory, who from the Vatican in Rome repaired Julius Caesar&#8217;s legacy with a one-time removal of 10 days from the calendar; without him we&#8217;d be on the wrong day. And finally to the Roman monk Dionysius Exiguus, who was perhaps worshiping Dionysus when he calculated the year 1; without him, it wouldn&#8217;t be &#8217;12. We should definitely be drinking these toasts with Italian wine.</p>
<p><strong>Time After Time</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s set the date aside again and go back to the time. 12:12:12 &#8212; 12 hours, 12 minutes, 12 seconds &#8212; after what? After midnight of course. Ah. Which midnight?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s <strong>astronomical midnight</strong> &#8212; the moment when your particular <em>point</em> on earth is exactly opposite the sun. And then there&#8217;s <strong>clock midnight</strong> &#8212; the moment when your <em>time zone</em> celebrates the start of a new day. These aren&#8217;t, generally, the same. In fact, astronomical midnight occurs about an hour earlier at the east edge of a time zone that it does at the west edge.</p>
<p>I say &#8220;about an hour earlier&#8221; because <a href="http://www.worldtimezone.com/" target="_blank">the time zones that we use around the world aren&#8217;t exact divisions of the earth into 24 equal slices</a>, like an orange cut into equal wedges. In principle they should be, but they&#8217;re adjusted for a very non-astronomical reason &#8212; political concerns and societal convenience. It was judged inconvenient for the US state of Texas to be in two time zones, so the time zone dividing line was adjusted to put the entire state in the same zone. The union of Europe has led most of western and central continental Europe, from Spain to Poland, to join a single time zone; the United Kingdom, due north of France, remains in a different zone, even though, as Paris is almost due south of London, astronomical time in London and Paris are only about 10 minutes apart. In some parts of Europe, 12:12:12 occurs well before astronomical 11 o&#8217;clock! And then there&#8217;s China, a country the width of the continental United States. China uses a single time zone, while the continental US uses four. The time 12:12:12 occurs all at once across China, while it happens at four different hours across the United States.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even more arbitrariness hidden here. Astronomical midnight in Washington D.C. occurs fifteen minutes or so after astronomical midnight in New York, but then again, <em>neither</em> city&#8217;s astronomical midnight is the same as clock midnight within their shared time zone. In a given time zone, whose <em>astronomical</em> midnight determines the <em>clock</em> midnight? Due to a historical accident, the time zones were set in the 1880s as follows: astronomical midnight in the English town of Greenwich is set as clock midnight in the London time zone, and then all other time zones worldwide differ by one hour, two hours, three hours, and so on. (There are exceptions, where the shift involves an additional half hour [<em>e.g.</em>, all of India], or an additional fifteen minutes.) If human history had played out a little differently, and astronomical midnight in the London time zone had been set by astronomical midnight in the Swiss city of Geneva, then what we call 12:12:12 in New York would instead be called 11:55:32, or something like that. (I didn&#8217;t actually calculate the precise time shift; that&#8217;s an exercise for the reader.)</p>
<p>In short, if we want to measure 12:12:12 from <em>astronomical</em> midnight, the problem is that it doesn&#8217;t occur when the clock says 12:12:12; it may happen when the clock says 11:58:34, or 12:24:06, depending on exactly where we are located within our time zone. And if instead we do want to use clock time, we should remember that if it weren&#8217;t for the historical progression that set the London time zone on Greenwich astronomical time, then again our clocks would be shifted away from where we find them today.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s celebrate 12:12:12 &#8212; a time that, but for the grace of history and the strength and scientific prowess of the British Empire, might easily have been shifted by as much as half an hour in either direction &#8212; and in some countries with extended time zones, by as much as two or three hours!</p>
<p><strong>Today and Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>We have one more great accident to thank for today being 12/12/12 here in North and South America. I refer to the location of the International Date Line. It&#8217;s one thing to set all the time zones &#8212; starting from midnight in one time zone, around through noon, and back to midnight as you go round the world &#8212; so that they give roughly the same clock time as astronomical time. But you still have to decide what day it is. And it can&#8217;t be the same day everywhere on the earth at the same time! For instance, if it is midnight in London, it is after midnight in Moscow and before midnight in New York&#8230; so if London&#8217;s calendar says it is July 2nd, then so does Moscow&#8217;s, while in New York you would think it is July 1st. But then in San Francisco it is a few hours earlier on July 1st, and in Tokyo it is even earlier on July 1st; still earlier in Beijing and in New Delhi on July 1st; and back we come to Moscow very early on &#8230; July 1st??? Whoops! A contradiction. Somewhere around the earth we have to make the day jump. And that&#8217;s what the International Date Line is for. When you cross that line, the calendar day has to jump by one. That line is completely arbitrary too. It was placed at a convenient value of longitude, right down the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where it intersects no continents except for a corner of Siberia, and affects rather few people, mainly on small islands. So when it is before midnight on July 1st in New York and San Francisco, it is midday on July 2nd in Tokyo. And when it is 12/12/12 at 12:12 in the morning in New York, it is 12/13/12 in Tokyo already; Tokyo is not 11 hours <em>behind</em> New York, it is 24 &#8211; 11 = 13 hours <em>ahead</em>.</p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s another place where the International Date Line could have been conveniently placed: down the middle of the Atlantic. There&#8217;s just enough room between the continents to squeeze it in. And if that were the case, instead of New York being 5 hours <em>behind</em> London time, it would be 24 &#8211; 5 = 19 hours <em>ahead</em> of London time. In other words, it would already be 12/13/12 here in North and South America.</p>
<p>Thus we celebrate 12/12/12 here in New York today because of the location and shapes of the continents and the oceans, and because of the arbitrary choice to locate the International Date Line on the ocean between the Americas and Asia, and not on the ocean that separates the Americas from Europe and Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Rant</strong></p>
<p>By this point I hope you have a very healthy distrust of date-based and time-based numerology. Up to now it&#8217;s been fun, but I also want to remind you how this gets misused. For instance, let&#8217;s recall Harold Camping, former head of Family Radio Stations, whose ludicrous prophesies of the end of the world led many of his followers to give their money to his ministry and to dispense with all their worldly belongings. Yet it was completely obvious he was a solatic. (A lunatic is a person who becomes crazy when in the presence of the moon; but Camping was obviously nuts in broad daylight.) This became clear when not only did he predict a date &#8212; May 21, 2011 &#8212; of the earth&#8217;s destruction, but also a time: 6 p.m.</p>
<p><em>Ummm.. that&#8217;s 6 p.m. <strong>where</strong>? according to whose clock?<br />
</em></p>
<p>Camping&#8217;s answer: local time.</p>
<p><em>Is that astronomical time or clock time?</em></p>
<p>The answer wasn&#8217;t very sharp, but seemed to be: clock time.</p>
<p><em>Is that Standard Time or Daylight Savings Time?</em> (A chunk of the Northern Hemisphere, heading into its summer, was on Daylight Savings time. The Southern Hemisphere, heading into its winter, was not.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we ever got an answer to that.</p>
<p>So: we were asked to believe that Camping was brilliant enough to carry out the numerology necessary to determine, from a document written down and unchanged for more than 1600 years, that divine forces would begin to destroy the earth on a particular date this year. And yet we learned, from his own predictions, that he was silly enough to infer from this ancient document that the destruction would start at the International Date Line (an arbitrary human convention that dates back only 125 years) and at 6 pm (using a method of timekeeping that is a human convention and did not exist even 200 years ago) working its way time zone by time zone (even though time zones are a human convention that dates back 125 years, and the time zones are heavily modified from astronomical time by political redrawings of their boundaries) and would perhaps even destroy the Southern and Northern hemispheres at slightly different rates because of the use of Daylight Savings Time in some northern regions.</p>
<p>In short, we learned Harold Camping doesn&#8217;t know too much about the real world.</p>
<p>It might be worth mentioning that when the New Testament was written down, the mistake of getting year 1 of the Christian era in the wrong place hadn&#8217;t happened yet. And of course Pope Gregory hadn&#8217;t removed his 10 days from the calendar yet either. I&#8217;m not sure, of course, but I&#8217;m willing to bet Camping didn&#8217;t know about these issues and probably didn&#8217;t correct for them.</p>
<p>So since Camping clearly didn&#8217;t understand some basic issues in timekeeping, why in heaven&#8217;s name did anyone give him the time of day, much less millions of dollars? And why couldn&#8217;t we have stopped him from damaging the lives of so many innocent people? It is too late for Camping&#8217;s followers, but perhaps we can be better prepared for the next round. At least, we should bring justifiable discredit on this type of numerology, pointing out its many logical flaws.</p>
<p><strong>End of rant</strong></p>
<p>There; I&#8217;m finally done. So glasses up, and let&#8217;s make a final toast to 12/12/12 12:12:12 &#8212; a consequence of misaligned astronomical orbital periods, calculation errors, ancient political decisions, Western hegemony, human physiology, historical anachronisms, religious doctrine, and Babylon. On the absurdity scale from one to ten, it surely scores a twelve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The promised follow-up article on <a title="A Real Workshop" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/07/a-real-workshop/">the workshop last week in Waterloo, Canada</a> will have to wait til Monday; I had too many scientific activities and chores to take care of today, and I want to make sure the article, which is a bit complicated, is nevertheless clear.   But in the meantime, let&#8217;s celebrate Martian Curiosity!</p>
<p>First, a big congratulations to the NASA folks!  Very impressive, and fantastically cool.  I was a huge fan of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, especially of their 3D photography.  Looking at those photos on a big screen, through red/green 3D glasses. brought me to sweeping Martian vistas and deep Martian craters &#8212; as vivid and as close as I&#8217;ll ever see them.  It was amazing stuff, and I look forward to more from the new rover.</p>
<p>Next: some perspective. <span id="more-4191"></span>Some people have complained that building this machine and getting it to Mars cost 2.5 billion dollars.  Well, most of that 2.5 billion got spent on Earth, spread out over many years; much of it funded people&#8217;s salaries, and in particular some of it allowed companies to pay and train highly skilled engineers and scientists, who will continue to contribute to the world economy through further technological development.  So the 2.5 billion number means nothing until you do a more careful analysis to decide how much of it was simply spent on perishable things like rocket fuel, and how much of it was invested in something that has future growth potential.  Moreover, the scientific knowledge obtained from Curiosity may have value that we cannot foresee.  Meanwhile, there&#8217;s an estimate that the London Olympic Games cost about 15 billion dollars.  Think about that for a while.  The two numbers are not without ambiguities, so don&#8217;t take the precise ratio too seriously.  But one does have to wonder why people are accusing NASA of wasting their money.</p>
<p>Finally, have you looked at <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/" target="_blank">the instruments that Curiosity is carrying</a>?   There&#8217;s a huge amount of modern physics there, most of it involving quantum mechanics, and subatomic physics in particular.   Beams of <a href="http://www.dentallearning.org/course/fde0030/x-ray_characteristics.htm" target="_blank">X-rays</a>, <a href="http://education.jlab.org/glossary/alphaparticle.html" target="_blank">alpha particles</a>, and neutrons, along with machines to detect the ones that bounce back; lasers, spectrographs, and <a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/masspec/howitworks.html" target="_blank">mass spectrometers</a>; and tricks involving <a href="http://space.about.com/od/nebulae/a/Source-of-Cosmic-Rays.htm" target="_blank">cosmic rays</a>.  It&#8217;s all stuff from 20th or nearly-20th century quantum physics, involving things you would learn as a physics student as early as freshman year and as late as graduate school in nuclear and/or subnuclear physics.  Maybe someday I&#8217;ll walk you through all the physics packed into the rover.  If you&#8217;re curious.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope you&#8217;re all ready for today&#8217;s transit of Venus across the face of the Sun.  You certainly can&#8217;t have missed that it&#8217;s happening, given the media hype.  (Look at the website <a href="http://transitofvenus.nl/wp/">http://transitofvenus.nl/wp/</a>, their post from yesterday in particular, for all sorts of useful resources, including timing for the event in various locations, and on-line resources for you to watch in case clouds interfere at your location. <em>UPDATE: that website is overwhelmed. In the continental U.S. transit begins just after 6 pm Eastern, 3 pm Pacific, differing by a few minutes from place to place; and sunset will occur before the transit is over. One online location to watch the transit is <a href="http://events.slooh.com/">http://events.slooh.com/</a></em>)   But &#8212; let me be the first to warn you &#8212; this is going to be very cool, but it isn&#8217;t going to be a spectacular event like a big meteor shower or a total solar eclipse or even a total lunar eclipse.  It&#8217;s going to be subtle, slow, and potentially very boring, unless you have the right mindset (or a truly excellent telescope, properly filtered for sun viewing).  So here are some suggestions:<span id="more-3728"></span></p>
<p>Binoculars are a very good idea &#8212; DON&#8217;T LOOK THROUGH THEM!!!  From the side and well away from anyone&#8217;s eyes, project the image of the sun through the binoculars onto a white sheet of paper, which you want to have perpendicular to the line between the sun and the binoculars so that the sun&#8217;s image is nice and round.  If you move the binoculars away from the paper the image will get larger; you can focus the image the same way you always do.  (A small telescope would be even better but not everyone&#8217;s got one handy.)  Proper solar eclipse glasses (NOT SUNGLASSES!) will let you look at the sun safely (don&#8217;t do it for too long even with the glasses) but expect Venus to be pretty small.  If you don&#8217;t already have the glasses, forget looking at the sun directly.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss the onset of the transit!!!!  which lasts about 15 minutes.  Or if you miss that, catch the end if you can.  This is going to be the most dynamic and evocative part of the transit, (<em>except perhaps sunset in the US, Canada, Mexico etc. or sunrise in Europe and Africa &#8211; see below)</em>.  It will be during this period that it is easiest to detect the actual motion of Venus &#8212; to really see Venus traveling in its stately procession around the sun at the speed of 35 kilometers (about 20 miles) per <strong>second.</strong> It&#8217;s very rare that you can actually sense the motions of the planets with your own eyes &#8212; this may be your best chance!</p>
<p>During the transit, you have a chance to grasp how huge stars are.  Right now Venus is only a third as far away as the Sun, so it will appear three times larger in radius and about ten times larger in area than it would appear if it were placed right next to the sun.  So look at Venus, imagine it three times smaller in radius or ten times smaller in area, and that will tell you how large is the sun compared to Venus.  And then remember that Venus is just about the same size as the Earth &#8212; so <em><strong>you will see, with your own eyes and a little imagination, just how small the Earth is compared to an average star. </strong></em></p>
<p>Consider and enjoy the historical significance of these rare transits, how with the use of <a title="Parallax: Seeing in Depth" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/parallax-seeing-in-depth/" target="_blank">parallax</a> they could be employed, in the mid 18th century, to obtain the best measurements yet (accurate to about 2%) of the great distances between the planets and the sun.   You can read <a title="Transit of Venus and the Distance to the Sun" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/transit-of-venus-and-the-distance-to-the-sun/" target="_blank">my new article on that subject, just finished today.</a></p>
<p>Finally, sometimes at sunset the glare is reduced enough that it is safe briefly to glance at the sun.  Don&#8217;t do it for more than a few seconds, but it might give you a naked-eye opportunity to glimpse Venus, just as sometimes one can see sunspots at sunset.  And if you&#8217;re a photographer with a powerful telephoto lens, or better a proper telescope, you&#8217;ll have an opportunity for a great shot.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all! I said that posts would be sparse for a couple of weeks, but I didn&#8217;t realize quite how sparse! But I&#8217;m gradually getting back on-line here.</p>
<p>Right now, what&#8217;s occupying my attention for the next 48 hours is all in the sky: three crescents, and a ring. I&#8217;ll be brief, but if you want more explanation about the geometry involved, you might want to read my very relevant article about <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/reflections-on-beauty-in-motion/" target="_blank">geometry and the beauty of the heavens.<span id="more-3585"></span></a></p>
<p><strong>Crescent Venus</strong>: If you look just after sunset in the western sky between now and the end of the month, you&#8217;ll see Venus shining brilliantly in the twilight, but seeming to plummet, day by day, toward the Sun. This is all in preparation for Venus to pass between the Earth and the Sun, during June 6th&#8217;s last-in-a-lifetime &#8220;transit.&#8221; But if you have good binoculars (and good vision, I&#8217;m afraid &#8212; if not, you&#8217;ll need a small telescope), you&#8217;ll discover Venus is not a dot, or a disk, right now &#8212; it is a crescent. With a small telescope you&#8217;ll see just how thin and large a crescent it is. Venus, in preparation for its transit, is almost as close to Earth as it ever gets &#8212; hence it appears large &#8212; but since it is closer to the Sun than the Earth, almost all of the part of Venus that faces toward the Earth is facing away from the Sun, and is therefore in shadow. One half of Venus faces toward us; a different half faces the Sun and is therefore lit; and these two halves only overlap along a fingernail crescent.</p>
<p><strong>Crescent Moon</strong>: If you were up before sunrise the last couple of days, you&#8217;ve seen a thin crescent Moon in the eastern sky, because the &#8220;New Moon&#8221; (the start of a new cycle of lunar phases) is happening shortly, and before the New Moon there are always crescent Moons in the morning twilight. After the New Moon, there is a crescent Moon in the evening twilight. Look for a fingernail crescent Moon just after sunset in the western sky on Monday and Tuesday nights. The crescent is there for the same reason that it is there for Venus: the Sun lights one half of the Moon; we see one half also; but the visible half and the lit half overlap only on a crescent. The pairing of the crescent Moon and the crescent Venus will make a lovely pair to look at with good binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>Crescent Sun</strong>: on Sunday, May 20th (in the United States; it will be Monday the 21st on the other side of the arbitrary International Date Line) the &#8220;New Moon&#8221; will transit the Sun, just a few days before Venus does the same trick. But there is very different geometry involved &#8212; Venus, so far away, will appear to transit the Sun from much of Earth, and will appear so small that it will block only a tiny portion of the Sun&#8217;s light &#8212;- whereas the Moon is so close that its transit is visible only from a smaller portion of Earth, but there is a small region of the Earth where <strong><em>almost all</em></strong> of the Sun&#8217;s light will be blocked. For this reason we call such a transit an &#8220;solar eclipse&#8221; &#8212; but let us remember that it is basically the same thing as a transit. For those who are in the region where the eclipse is visible, you will see a crescent Sun. <em><strong>But note:</strong> </em>such crescents are not the same shape as those seen on Venus or the Moon. The geometry is different. Think about it. Hint: there will not be a &#8220;half Sun&#8221; the way there is a &#8220;half Moon&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>A Reminder and Warning:</strong> Do not look at the sun if it is only partially blocked, as will be the case everywhere in this eclipse. Make sure your children understand this. There are a very few safe ways to look at an eclipse of the sun; they are <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/eclipses/3306081.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;">all over the internet</span></a> (but get a second opinion, I have seen errors on some webpages) so I won&#8217;t try to summarize them here.</em></span></p>
<p>And finally: <strong>a Ring</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Sun minus the Moon</strong>: It is a remarkable accident that our Moon and our Sun, at very different distances from Earth and of very different sizes, appear as disks of almost the same size in our skies. This means that when the Moon transits the Sun, it can &#8212; in those locations on Earth where the Moon&#8217;s center appears to cross the Sun&#8217;s center &#8212; completely or almost completely hide the Sun. Because the Moon and Sun do not maintain exactly the same relative size in the sky &#8212; distances between the Earth, Sun and Moon are not exactly constant, as the orbits of these objects are not exactly circular &#8212; it happens that sometimes the Moon will appear a little smaller than the Sun, with the effect that the Moon will not quite cover the Sun even if, from your point of view, it crosses the Sun dead center. This is the case during this eclipse. Rather than a total eclipse of the Sun, where the Sun&#8217;s entire disk is covered by the Moon (making the Sun&#8217;s outer atmosphere visible), this eclipse will be different (neat but less extraordinary) because a small but still <strong>dangerously bright</strong> ring of sunlight will remain even when the Moon&#8217;s center and Sun&#8217;s center are exactly lined up. This ring or &#8220;annulus&#8221; of sunshine is the source of the name &#8220;annular eclipse&#8221;.  In short, take the Sun&#8217;s disk, subtract the Moon&#8217;s slightly smaller-appearing disk, and what remains is a ring of sunshine. Don&#8217;t look at it directly at any point during the eclipse! If you do, you&#8217;d better have specially designed eclipse glasses or the right kind of welding glass <em>(and don&#8217;t take chances with your eyesight, please! remember your eyes can be damaged without you feeling a thing.)</em>  But enjoy it safely, savor the magic of the dance of the Sun and Moon &#8212; the former about 400 times larger in radius, the latter about 400 times closer &#8212; and consider how lucky this planet is to have these special astronomical treats.</p>
<p>No matter where you live, you can at least enjoy the first two crescents. As for me, with a little luck on the weather, I&#8217;ll be looking at all three crescents, and the ring too. Reports to follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why does the sight of the Moon draw our gaze and silence our voices? What is it about the planets, those exceptionally bright points of light that wander among the stars, that we instinctively find so beautiful?  Is it perhaps that they make us dream of faraway, unreachable places? Is it that they are beacons in the night, nature&#8217;s candle flames, helping keep fear at bay, and offering us hope amid darkness? Or is it perhaps that they seem to float &#8212; we do love things that float, whether they be autumn leaves, balloons, clouds or birds &#8212; suspended in the sky, in apparent defiance of the force of gravity which keeps us pinned to the Earth?</p>
<p>This last thought offers a certain delicious irony&#8230; for in truth the planets and the Moon, in their procession above our heads, obey gravity&#8217;s dictates.</p>
<p>The next few days, weather permitting, will give us a chance to contemplate these questions. Our planet&#8217;s natural satellite, on its monthly trip around the Earth, will pass three of the brighter planets in the sky, creating one lovely spectacle after another. Of course, the Moon really passes nowhere near the planets, just as your outstretched hand, when it blocks your view of the Moon, is nowhere near the Moon itself. It is all a matter of perspective &#8212; of geometry, of cavernous spaces, of the play of light, and of the elegant choreography of the solar system.  But this perspective is not something we sense easily.  Our eyes can perceive no depth for objects so far away, and so our brains form a two-dimensional picture from the three dimensions of the universe, projecting the Moon, the planets and the stars, at extraordinary distances from one another, onto a psychologically flat black screen of the night sky. It takes great mental effort to see things as they are, and not as they appear. This, too, is worthy of contemplation.</p>
<p>First, on the night of February 22nd, just after sunset (don&#8217;t be late!), one of the most delicate of nocturnal sights awaits:   <a title="Reflections on Beauty in Motion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/reflections-on-beauty-in-motion/">Click here to read more</a>&#8230;</p>
