										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Wow</strong></em>, it was <a title="Happy (Chilly) New Year" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">unusually cold last week</a>. In a small fraction of the globe. For a couple of days. And what does that cold snap, that big wiggle in the <em><strong><span style="color:#00ccff;">Polar Vortex</span></strong></em> that carries high-atmospheric winds around the North Pole, imply about &#8220;climate change&#8221;, also known as &#8220;global warming&#8221;, also known as &#8220;global weirding&#8221;?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple. <strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
<p>If you heard anyone suggest otherwise &#8212; whether they said that the extreme <em><strong>cold</strong></em> implies that there is <em>no</em> global warming going on, or they said that the <em><strong>extreme</strong></em> cold implies that global warming <em>is</em> happening &#8212; you should seriously question anything that person says when it comes to climate change. Because that person does not respect (or perhaps even understand) the difference between anecdote and evidence; between weather and climate; between a large fluctuation and a small but long-term trend. Or between media hoopla and science.</p>
<p>In the interest of an imperfect analogy: Let me ask you this. Are you generally happier, or less happy, than you were five years ago? Answer this as best you can.</p>
<p>Now let me ask you another question. Did you, within the last month, have a really, really bad day, or a really, really good one?</p>
<p>Does the answer to the second question have much to do with the answer to the first one?</p>
<p>Barring an exceptional recent disaster in your personal or professional life, the fact that, say, last Thursday your car broke down, you locked yourself out of your house, your dog vomited on the carpet and you got caught in the rain without your umbrella does not have anything to do with whether you are a happier person than you were five years ago. Being a happier person has more to do with whether you have a better job, a happier family, a better sense of self-esteem, and things like that. And even if you love your job, you know there are going to be really bad days in the office sometimes. That&#8217;s just the way it goes. We all know that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart" target="_blank">daily and monthly and yearly fluctuations in the stock market</a> compared to the <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/usgdp/graph.php" target="_blank">slow but fairly steady century-long growth of the U.S. economy</a> (both curves corrected for inflation.)</p>
<p><strong><em>So why, when there&#8217;s a big fluctuation in the daily, monthly or even seasonal weather, do people jump up and down about what the implications are for the long-term trends in climate?<span id="more-7104"></span></em></strong></p>
<p>Any one fluctuation, whether hot or cold, dry or wet, windy or calm, is by itself irrelevant. Weather fluctuates; that&#8217;s just how it is. It&#8217;s by no means unusual, now or in the distant past, for temperatures in the central United States to swing by 50ºF (28ºC) in just a few hours. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.weather.com/news/5-extreme-temperature-drops-20130118" target="_blank">a fun story by the Weather Channel</a> listing a few extreme temperature swings, all of which were more dramatic than the recent cold spell.  Weather in the U.S. has seen extremes since before Europeans arrived here and started recording their experiences, and it will continue to do so whether global warming persists or not.</p>
<p>Moreover, the recent cold wasn&#8217;t as exceptional as portrayed in the press, or as it seemed to people under the age of 40. One of the reasons that so many records were set this past week was that January 7th, over the past century, hasn&#8217;t previously seen an exceptionally cold day in the southeast. Specifically, let&#8217;s look at Greensboro, North Carolina, which was <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/coldest-jan-7-ever-15-record-low-temperatures-set-polar-vortex-1531012" target="_blank">described in the press as follows</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Greensboro, N.C., also witnessed a major drop in its record low temperature, going from a previous record of 14 degrees to 5 degrees. &#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, what were (before this year) the record temps in that town during the first 10 days of January? (see <a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/climate/data/gso.daily.records.temp.precip.html">http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/climate/data/gso.daily.records.temp.precip.html</a>)</p>
<p>Jan 1: 8<br />
Jan 2: 5<br />
Jan 3: 7<br />
Jan 4: 3<br />
Jan 5: 3<br />
Jan 6: 5<br />

Jan 8: 6<br />
Jan 9: 2<br />
Jan 10: 1<br />
Jan 11: -5</p>
<p>In other words, the previous century or so of January 7ths were unusual &#8212; every other day in early January had already seen a very cold day! <em>All this recent cold snap did was bring it into line with other cold early January days!</em> A similar story held true in Atlanta. In short, despite the &#8220;record cold&#8221; media hype, quite a few of the new &#8220;records&#8221; weren&#8217;t especially exceptional for January&#8230; they were &#8220;normal&#8221; records, not worthy of the amazement expressed by reporters and citizens alike.</p>
<p>The issue this highlights is that if you want to tell whether the climate is getting warmer, the record high and low temperatures on a given day aren&#8217;t going to tell you much! The record temperatures fluctuate and are subject to random, extraordinary events. We don&#8217;t know how rare those exceptional events are, and the more wild and spectacular they are, the less we know about them.  If something happens once every one, three or ten centuries, but we only have one century of records, we&#8217;ve only seen it happen once or perhaps twice, if ever.  So when it happens, we can&#8217;t say &#8220;aha, that&#8217;s something that would not have happened if it weren&#8217;t for climate change&#8221;. We can&#8217;t draw such a conclusion, anymore than we can conclude that your stunningly bad day at work last week implies that your job, in the grand scheme of things, isn&#8217;t going to be as fulfilling in future as it used to be.</p>
<p>Take a look at this plot, from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KSAT&amp;SafeCityName=San_Antonio&amp;StateCode=TX&amp;Units=none&amp;IATA=SAT" target="_blank">the website Weather Underground</a>, which tells us something about the weather and climate in San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">It shows, for each day of the year, over many years, the average high and average low temperatures in blue, and the </span>record daily highs and lows in red. <span style="color:#808080;"><em>[Unfortunately I do not know exactly how many years are included in this data; I would estimate 60 years, but Weather Underground does not provide this important information &#8212; and they should.]  </em></span>Of course the average and record highs and lows all trend higher in the summer and lower in the winter, as expected. But notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>the average highs and lows are smooth curves</li>
<li>the record highs and lows are jagged curves</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because for each day, <em>every year contributes to the average</em>. Year-to-year fluctuations for each day get smoothed out, as do day-to-day fluctuations in each year. So the curve showing the average is smooth as you move from one day to the next.</p>
<p>By contrast, only special, unique, remarkable, extraordinary days contribute to the record high and record low on a particular day. These are subject to large day-to-day fluctuations, because something extraordinary may have happened on January 9th of some 20th century year, but not on January 10th or 8th.</p>
<p>So a specific event with record heat or record cold isn&#8217;t useful for telling us about climate change.  Though impressive, it just represents the vagaries of life that get in the way of us understanding the real long-term trend, just as a truly bad day can make someone forget, for a short while anyway, that his or her life is going pretty well on the whole.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with extreme hurricanes and tornadoes, droughts and floods. These are too rare, and require too many elements to come together in a unique mix, for us to easily conclude anything about them. Hurricanes Irene and Sandy were a big deal in and around New York City; but are they signs of global warming?! What about the devastating 1938 hurricane that hit eastern New England? What about the two strong hurricanes that struck New England, a month apart, in 1869? It&#8217;s impossible to conclude that Irene and Sandy are related to global warming/weirding. Only if you see something steady over decades &#8212; the average storm becoming stronger, or the average number of storms rising &#8212; or a dramatic trend &#8212; Irene and Sandy-like storms ceasing to be rare and becoming once-every-other-year events over decades &#8212; will you be able to draw any conclusions from hurricanes that the climate has really changed.</p>
<p>No&#8230; if you want to determine whether global warming is occurring, you must set aside the record high or low temperatures, the extreme storms, the exceptional events&#8230; the ones that the media reports, and the ones that you yourself easily remember. Instead, you need to look at the averages &#8212; which is where the data is sufficient, and sufficiently stable, <a title="Climate Change in Climate Change" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/24/climate-change-in-climate-change/" target="_blank">for some conclusion that the Earth has slightly warmed</a> (by just 1 &#8211; 2 ºF = 0.5 &#8211; 1.1ºC &#8211;which is still <a href="http://themadisonenergygroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Ag_Upsala_Glacier.jpg" target="_blank">enough to melt a lot of glaciers</a>)  to be drawn. And even our current 100 years of data from around the globe is just barely enough to make that possible.  I&#8217;ll cover that issue another time.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s not waste our time fishing for red herrings.  Yes, it is possible that an overall small increase in the temperature of the globe will make wild weather more common. But it will be decades before we have enough data to tell whether, in fact, the rare events of which we have so few examples really are more or less common than they used to be.  And no one event, in isolation, should ever be mentioned in the same sentence as &#8220;climate change&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My neighborhood of New York City may remain without power for a few more days, but fortunately visible signs of damage are limited &#8212; none of the widespread destruction found along the immediate coast of the city and of nearby communities, where the sea rose and swallowed up land that had not seen salt water in many decades, even centuries.  Many trees are down, and countless houses and businesses are wiped out by the sea&#8217;s wrath, even entire beach communities. The numbers of lost homes are surely in the thousands, if not more, with 100 houses alone destroyed in a runaway fire in the neighborhood of Breezy Point, cut off from firefighters by the storm&#8217;s high water.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people along the coast, lulled into complacency by the fact that last year&#8217;s Tropical Storm (formerly Hurricane) Irene was a bit less furious along the coast than was forecast, decided not to evacuate. Unfortunately indeed, because the forecast for Hurricane Sandy was worse than for Irene, and this time, there was no lucky break to make the reality of the storm significantly less severe than the worst-case prediction.  I myself know of households who decided to evacuate at the last minute and almost didn&#8217;t make it out alive, and others who rode out the storm and found themselves in considerable danger. That so many people remained in harm&#8217;s way required &#8220;first responders&#8221;, as they are termed here, mainly members of the police and fire departments, to make many rescues, quite a few of which wouldn&#8217;t have been necessary had people heeded the warnings. For risking their lives to save so many others, the first responders are widely and justifiably hailed as heroes.</p>
<p>Also deserving of high praise, in my view, are some of the leading politicians and other civic leaders in our region&#8217;s states and cities.  There are quite of few of them whom I don&#8217;t agree with politically and whom I personally don&#8217;t like very much, but on the whole they all seem very smart.   And in this case they understood the risks, took them seriously, and made prudent decisions to order evacuations of areas in danger and to protect public property.  They deserve a lot of credit for their non-nonsense approach.</p>
<p>But I feel that there&#8217;s an important story that the press is almost ignoring.  There&#8217;s another group of people, little-mentioned in the media, who probably saved more lives and property than anyone else.  I refer to the experts at the National Hurricane Center (<a href="http://nhc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NHC</a>), and more generally the various branches of the National Weather Service (<a href="http://www.weather.gov/" target="_blank">NWS</a>) and its parent, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<a href="http://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA</a>).<span id="more-4856"></span></p>
<p>As I already suggested in <a title="North-East Winds A-Blowin’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/29/north-east-winds-a-blowin/" target="_blank">my post from Monday</a>, we should view the forecast of Hurricane Sandy&#8217;s sudden turn toward the coast of New Jersey, and its transformation from a minor category 1 hurricane into an uncategorizable (but categorical) monster, as a stunning achievement &#8212; a historic success of scientific research.  Actually it appears to be several stunning accomplishments in one: the forecast of the unusual track; the forecast of the unusual increase in strength and size; the forecast of a powerful blizzard in the mountains of West Virginia and other nearby states; and the forecast of the extremely high storm surge along Long Island, northern New Jersey and New York Harbor that would prove to be some of the most damaging elements of the storm.  These forecasts were all of highly complex and interrelated phenomena, and very challenging even for the most advanced scientific methods.</p>
<p>And what amazes me is that the forecasters did this successfully <strong><em>despite never having observed a storm of this type before.</em></strong></p>
<p>This, of course, is how science is supposed to work, when it is at its best.  From studies of simpler examples, focusing on one or two elements at a time, scientists guess equations that allow rudimentary predictions of complex phenomena such as fluids <em>(i.e. gasses and liquids)</em> in general, weather more specifically and hurricanes in particular.  Over time, looking at predictions that have succeeded and others that have failed, they improve the equations, accounting for more and more of the underlying processes.  And finally the equations are good enough that they work most of the time; anyone who follows hurricane forecasting knows that the paths of hurricanes are much more reliably predicted than they were even fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>Yet when the day comes that an unusual combination of events arises &#8212; a hurricane moving north, a blocking air pattern to the east, a strong front to the west, an upper level disturbance moving south, etc. &#8212; and the equations respond by predicting a storm of unprecedented power on an extraordinary track, then even the bravest of scientists has to wonder: have the equations gone mad?  Have they been asked to predict the future in an extreme situation where they cannot be trusted?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the experts were nervous about their forecast.  But as time went on and all of the different computer models, which are similar in their science but differ in their details, gave more or less the same prediction, they appeared to become more and more confident.  And they got it basically right.</p>
<p>Imagine, for a moment, that no one had invested over the last few decades in hurricane forecasting&#8230; that government-funded long-term research was viewed as a waste of money, and that the only funding provided was for research that was likely to lead to near-term economic benefit.  Well, none of those predictions would have been there for us last weekend.  On Monday, a breezy, raw, rainy fall morning, we all would have gone to work with no special worries&#8230; until we headed home for the evening rush hour.  And then we would have found ourselves stuck on the roads by the tens of thousands in traffic jams, unable to get home, as trees fell and rivers flooded, highways became impassable, electricity went out, subway trains were stopped by rising water, and heaven knows what else.  As the evening high tide arrived in New York and Connecticut, nine feet above normal, and as the storm&#8217;s worst rains and winds pounded the New Jersey Coast, many people would have been trapped, and the number of trains, planes, boats, buses, cars, power plants, homes and businesses that would have been unprotected against water damage would have been enormously higher than it was.</p>

<p>This nightmare isn&#8217;t fiction; it&#8217;s history. Something much like it did happen in 1938, in the <a href="http://www.northshorewx.com/Hurricane19380921.asp" target="_blank">Long Island Express hurricane</a>, though fortunately in a somewhat less populated area.  It didn&#8217;t happen this time, because we had many days of warning.  We were told exactly what to worry about &#8212; that there would be many hours of strong winds and rain, tremendous tree damage, flooding along the coast, feet of snow inland.  In New York City we were warned how high the high tide might be: 6 to 11 feet above normal.  (The actual storm surge was nine feet in New York Harbor, a total tide of nearly 14 feet above low water, easily enough to flood the subway and car tunnels and many streets along the waterfront.)   Thanks to these warnings, people were evacuated from danger zones, trains were moved to high ground, highways that often flood were closed, and resources that were needed for cleanup, especially for restoration of power, were brought into position to be ready as soon as the storm was over.  Just imagine the death and damage we might be reading about today, had this not happened.</p>
<p>All the talk in the media is about the 20 or 30 billion dollars that repairs from this storm might cost.  But even though it can&#8217;t be easily estimated, shouldn&#8217;t there be some discussion of the additional billions, perhaps tens of billions, that the National Hurricane Center saved this country in reduced damage and in reduced loss of productivity&#8230; significantly more money than was spent on the entire NOAA budget this year?  And then there are the lives saved.  Those of us who, thanks to the forecast, chose to evacuate, buy extra food and medicine, stay home from work, put off travel, keep our kids home, invite our elderly relatives to stay, and so forth ought all to send a heartfelt thank you note to the forecasters and to all the people who made those forecasts possible &#8212; everyone from the Hurricane Hunter aviators who fly into hurricanes like Sandy to collect the best possible data about these storms to the no-longer-young scientists who spent decades patiently trying to understand what makes these storms tick.  They deserve to be celebrated for what they are: heroes.</p>

<p>As Sandy approaches the coast I am very thankful for my former colleagues at the <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab</a> who have spent decades trying to make better predictions of tropical cyclones. And the colleagues around the world who have spent decades developing the techniques of observing and modeling the physics of cyclones. Both the recurving of the storm and the high storm surge (currently already at major flood levels at a number of points between NY and DE) would have taken tens of thousands of people, at a minimum, by surprise. Kurihara&#8217;s first paper in the line of research that led to today&#8217;s prediction (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/results.php?author=1061" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/results.php?author=1061</a>) was in 1965. It took him almost a decade to get to the first three-dimensional model of a hurricane and another couple of decades to improve the models to the point where they showed useful skill.</p>
<div>Just a little plug &#8212; it is important to remember that this kind of event, low-probability, high impact, is what well-run government is for. Putting together a storm-surge warning system for NY Harbor is not something that a private company is likely to do &#8212; the chances of it being used in any given 10-year period are so small as to make it a worthless investment. And the research that goes into making a forecast like this involves understanding of small-scale turbulence, understanding the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere and its interaction with multiple scatterers and absorbers, figuring out how to put weather satellites into orbit and keep them running, figuring out how to incorporate this information in computer codes, getting these codes to run reproducibly on large numbers of processors&#8230; almost all of this was accomplished by people working on the government dime.</div>
