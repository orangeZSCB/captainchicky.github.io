I have been wondering about this matter myself Matt. I have found myself on the same side of an online discussion/argument as Dr. Weinstein on a couple of occasions over the past several years. I remember that I appreciated his input/agreement. However, until a few days ago I had no idea he had been working on his physics for over two decades! 

Anyway Duncan, I just read that he will give his Oxford Lecture again tomorrow. If true, I suspect it will have better attendance than last week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/23/how-icecube-observes-neutrinos-from-the-cosmos/#comment-60479&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;.

“Only it happens so rarely we’ve never observed it.” Processes so rare they have never been observed. 

I see…like Proton decay. You will forgive my skepticism. I guess we all have our prejudices, and in light of the fact that there is no experimental evidence either way, you will kindly allow me mine. I favor holding on to the conservation laws (call me old-fashioned) that physics has recently (from an historical perspective) thrown under the bus. Until experimental evidence indicates otherwise, I do not believe in any violation of the Law of Conservation of Baryon Number. I know why physics dumped it – you can’t get the universe going with it. You need those antiprotons or their massive antimatter equivalents to decay at a slightly greater rate than those protons or their massive matter equivalents – though you have experimental evidence for neither. And no one seems to ever ask, let alone answer, why nature would favor a slower decay rate for matter over antimatter.

That is one of the reasons I almost always mention (here I go again) doing experiments to determine the gravitational acceleration of antimatter even though I know the vast majority of physicists regard such experiments as a waste of time and money owing to their faith in General Relativity. But GR notwithstanding, I am not terribly impressed with physicists professed ‘love’ of symmetry. It’s like the ‘love’ a husband professes for his wife from his mistresses hotel room. 

As to Conservation of Lepton Family Number I’m not even sure if physicists themselves have come to a consensus on its current status. Is it considered to hold now only for charged leptons?  Or is it as Paul maintains, its violation is expected but so rare it has never been observed? 

I still can’t help but wonder if there is a theory out there that would account for neutrino observations without sacrificing yet another conservation law.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for this video (conversation with Nima Arkani-Hamed) Mr Tienzen (Jeh-Tween) Gong ,
It took two hours to watch it. I felt, he carry a light inside him. Concrete spacetime will emerge ? 

PYTHAGOREANISM: When the apeiron is inhaled by the peiron it causes separation, which also apparently means that it &quot;separates and distinguishes the successive terms in a series.&quot; Instead of an undifferentiated whole we have a living whole of inter-connected parts separated by &quot;void&quot; between them. This inhalation of the apeiron is also what makes the world mathematical, not just possible to describe using maths, but truly mathematical since it shows numbers and reality to be upheld by the same principle. Both the continuum of numbers (that is yet a series of successive terms, separated by void) and the field of reality, the cosmos — both are a play of emptiness and form, apeiron and peiron.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In cognitive science, in artificial intelligence, mathematics seems useful because, it consider self (consciousness?) as, &quot;sedimentary informations (or genetical codes)&quot;. 
Sometimes mathematics seeming above consciousness. Example is &quot;Geometry of Pythagorean theorem&quot;. Human&#039;s geophysical understanding was basically &quot;Axion (Logos)&quot; - not on physical reality (Axion is a belief, not to have a mathematical proof).
Geometry is the perception of encapsulated quantum of action, in a photon, we call it mass (E = hv) - which was made as Dirac constant &quot;h-bar&quot; = h/2π. 
There is no comprehension of physical information without consciousness - it is not possible to replace it with mathematics.
Consciousness is non local, like physical information of a field(amplitude?).
The &quot;quanta&quot; is a localized consciousness through mathematics by E = hv. 
The matter wave or de Broglie waves reflects this connection. Out of this mathematical connection, non local de Broglie-Bohm theory was constructed?

This is the consequence of Pythagorean theorem.

Like perpetual (penrose) stairs, Mathematics connects the wavefunction (quanta) with π. Consciousness could perceive this quantum of action or mathematical quanta. 

This is possible only with photons, because of 3D space ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article as usual!

A few weeks ago I stated that (admittedly naively) my first guess would be:

Fermion Bosons
gimp gravitational
neutrino gravitational, weak
electron gravitational, weak, electromagnetic
quark gravitational, weak, electromagnetic, strong

but that I thought it is then difficult to give the “gimp” its mass through the Higgs mechanism. I recently found out that actually such a &quot;gimp&quot; (gravitationally interacting massive particle) naturally arises, in the form of a sterile neutrino, if one adds mass to neutrinos to account for neutrino oscillations. In this case the mass can indeed not be generated directly by the symmetry breaking but can be (or has to be) included in the Higgs mechanism (Yukawa coupling) and its mass is a free parameter. So at the moment this is the most natural candidate for gravitationally interacting dark matter. I also learned that many sterile neutrinos experiments are coming up and is at the top of the list for Sheldon Glashow.
So my question to you Matt: are you planning (if you haven&#039;t done so already) to write something about sterile neutrinos on your blog? 
Of course many thanks in advance!]]></description>
