I do not like the idea of fields (gravitational field, electromagnetic field, Higgs field), because as I understand it they restrict the freedom of travel/movement in space.So I am somewhat distrustful as to where they come from.]]></description>

A quantum, though a ripple in a field, is like a particle in that...
(*) it has a definite (and observer-independent) mass - observer independent means, agreed by mathematics ? 
Speed of the light is irrelevant at quantum level, unless otherwise, concrete 3D spacetime is proved ?]]></description>

I will explain how fields lead to forces soon.  To some degree I did here: https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/

I will not explain where fields come from, however.  Those are the most elementary things we know about; they aren&#039;t made from anything else, as far as we know today.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes Mr Russ Abbott,
inhalation of the apeiron (field) by the peiron (ripple) - separated by “void” between them - is also what makes the world mathematical, not just possible to describe using maths, but truly mathematical since it shows numbers and reality to be upheld by the same principle. 

Why the number and reality is same ? 

There is connection , surpassing consciousness, making it a  perpetual stairs ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. I&#039;m leaving this comment here since it&#039;s less technical than the force article.

What strikes me as amazing is that nature comes with built-in forces in the first place. The force article talks about how fields (and their ripples) interact with each other. But it doesn&#039;t say what it is about fields (and ripples in them) that leads to those interaction effects.]]></description>
