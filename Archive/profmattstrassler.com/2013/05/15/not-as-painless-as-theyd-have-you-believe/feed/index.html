					<description><![CDATA[@MattStrassler
Unlike the inital press conference and the later crucifiction of Pons and Fleischman, there are increasing evidence of actual unexplained heat production in Low Energy Nuclear Reactions and there is even a published theory by Widom and Larsen to explain it as revere beta decay in many body quantum lattices, followed by neutron capture reactions. There fore there is no actual cold fusion and the whole thing is consistent with known theory. Can you review the field for every one since many people wrongly assume the whole thing is fraud while some thing realy unusual with potential revolutionary implications is going on]]></description>

Einstein&#039;s most important work was done while in Europe. From 1933 on, he was at the IAS, and we could argue that his last important work of that period was the EPR paper (as it name indicates, it was a collaboration with Podolsky and Rosen), which was important as a critique to certain aspects of quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement in particular.

His last &quot;positive&quot; papers on quantum mechanics were focused on quantum statistical mechanics, like absortion and stimulated emmission of photons (the theory behind lasers and masers), and what eventually became known as Bose-Einstein Condensates, that is, the theory that predicts the behaviour of composite bosons at low temperatures.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

Matt, I accept your reasoning on sequester vs entitlement for your blog.

However, I would urge you to learn something about mandatory spending.  It is going to kill almost all science funding in this country over the next 10-20 years.  Since we agree the sequester is a symptom then surely it is to your advantage to understand the disease for self preservation if nothing else.  

There is no need to become an expert (nobody is) but it is vital you understand the scale of the problem.  You rightly object to mindless spending and policies like the sequester, but this is no different just larger.

BTW, if you want to know the Republican proposal on health care there is none any more than there is a monolithic Democratic proposal.  However this article (although written by a Democrat) is a conservative approach and is the finest article on health care policy ever written: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/09/how-american-health-care-killed-my-father/307617/ 

(Apologies in advance for the link since it is clearly outside the scope but you brought it up! :-) )]]></description>

I agree that the sequester is a symptom, but I don&#039;t agree that calling attention to the damage that it is causing across science has no use, since most people are unaware that this is a consequence.  

Meanwhile I cannot, on this website, address topics in which I am not even close to an expert, such as the web of entitlement programs.  I especially don&#039;t know how to deal with the fact that the health care situation has been out of control for decades, and this is a primary cause of the problem; but the Obama administration and the Democrats and Republicans in Congress blew a terrific opportunity a couple of years ago to grab some bipartisan control. I don&#039;t even know what the Republicans are proposing, and what came out of the Democratic-led Congress was a mess.  But the one thing I know for sure is that I do not understand the health-care system well enough to understand how the current health-care law will impact the US budget long-term.  So what useful could I say about this?

Meanwhile, the sequester makes an immediate impact on my career and the careers of those around me; it makes a measurable effect that I can report.  I&#039;m not a world&#039;s expert about it, but I do know first-hand some of what&#039;s going on.

Although the two issues are linked, the sequester is a very bad way of addressing the problems the country faces, because it is a blunt instrument.  Cuts are one thing; across-the-board cuts are another.]]></description>

That was late in his career, after almost all of his important work was over.  His main work after 1905 was done at European universities.

Moreover, the Institute for Advanced Study is hardly a model one can adopt for science as a whole.  It can support a small number of theoretical physicists, but no experimental physicists at all -- and experiments are the expensive part, both in materials and in personnel.  So what&#039;s your point?]]></description>
