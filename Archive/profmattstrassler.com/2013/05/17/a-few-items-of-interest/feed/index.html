It is great news that the focus is not just on the computer hardware, but equally on the physics of weather.

That modeling gap is apparently now getting attention, fortunately.]]></description>

Hmm.  Even your example contains many physics misconceptions and errors.  So I don&#039;t know where to start exactly.
It&#039;s not that your questions are frustrating, but there are so many things wrong here that it&#039;s not clear which ones to try to fix.

Shrapnel: speed and energy of shrapnel do not decrease after an explosion, except (a) when the shrapnel hits something, or (b) due to air resistance, i.e. friction due to air molecules that the shrapnel has to push out of the way. 
Shrapnel is heavy and thick; air that it passes through provides gradual friction; if the shrapnel hits something else that is heavy and thick it will bounce, but (unless the thing it hits is itself moving) the collision will &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; the energy of the shrapnel, or leave it the same, but will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; increase it.  Your shrapnel &quot;story&quot; simply is wrong.

But moreover, neutrinos interact with matter very differently from the way shrapnel does.  Neutrinos are tiny and light-weight; any material that a neutrino passes through involves objects (electrons, neutrons, protons) that are very heavy by comparison.  And neutrinos interact so weakly they will rarely hit anything; it&#039;s as though the material is very diffuse.  So this is more like tiny, tiny pieces of shrapnel passing through a parking lot that has no air and has a few trucks scattered around in it.  Most of the shrapnel will hit nothing.  The shrapnel that does hit something will lose energy.  In short; neutrinos passing through matter will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; generally gain energy -- your intuition for how things work was wrong, and this has misled you.

Even if the trucks in the parking lot are actually driving around, this generally won&#039;t help.  Only trucks driving faster than the shrapnel is moving are likely to give the shrapnel any extra energy.

So except in extraordinary circumstances, collisions with matter are generally going to lead to &lt;strong&gt;lower-energy&lt;/strong&gt; neutrinos, not higher-energy ones.  The matter will have to be moving at nearly the speed of light and be very dense for there to be any effect on neutrinos.  Instead, it will be much more efficient to create high-energy neutrinos in high-energy collisions of ordinary matter with &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; ordinary matter (electrons, protons, neutrons), rather than have the neutrinos themselves participate in bounces or ricochets off ordinary matter, which generally will cause them to &lt;strong&gt;lose&lt;/strong&gt; energy.

In short, interactions of neutrinos with ordinary matter are a very inefficient way to make high-energy neutrinos.  It&#039;s much more efficient to create high-energy ordinary matter, and then to create neutrinos in high-energy interactions of matter with matter]]></description>

Shrapnel is heavy and thick; air that it passes through provides gradual friction; if the shrapnel hits something else that is heavy and thick it will bounce, but (unless the thing it hits is itself moving) the collision will <em>decrease</em> the energy of the shrapnel, or leave it the same, but will <strong>not</strong> increase it.

This seems unlikely to me for several reasons.  Typically, such a cutoff would have a tail that falls off rather slowly, like 1/Energy^2 or so, just due to the fact that the original neutrino spectrum would have a tail, and the filter would also have a tail.  A spike due to slow dark matter decay would have a much more dramatic cutoff; the only tail would come from the dark matter&#039;s motion, but particles with a mass of 1 million GeV/c^2 will be moving well below the speed of light, with a Boltzmann distribution, which falls off exponentially.  

But a lot of data would be needed to tell the difference. We will have to wait a few years.]]></description>

You might try this MIT professor&#039;s blog (recently tenured) http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/ . It is not so easy to read, but it gives a more cautious view of the recent quantum computer hype.  My own impression is that there&#039;s something real happening in this story (which is indeed why Google is willing to shell out some money to explore it) but it&#039;s a much, much smaller and focused step than the media suggests.]]></description>
