Are those lines of right parentheses just serving as paragraph markers, or are they actual code of some kind? If they are meant as paragraph markers, I beg to suggest using something non-polar like ---- or ==== rather than the highly polar element )))) ! That is confusing!]]></description>

Matt thank you. There is a typo in your write up,  I found a paper in the archive on this. You have;

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/16/possible-important-discovery-at-icecube/#comment-123928&quot;&gt;Bob Zannelli&lt;/a&gt;.

The issue is a fundamental one.  Let&#039;s start with a case that you are probably familiar with. Hydrogen atoms are stable and don&#039;t decay.  However, an excited hydrogen atom will decay, emitting a photon and becoming a less excited (and possibly unexcited) hydrogen atom.  This probably doesn&#039;t bother you.

The idea for the proton is the same.  A proton in its ground state is stable.  An excited proton is not.  The only question is: how will the excited proton decay?

The simplest excited proton is called the &quot;Delta resonance&quot;.  This decays in 10^(-23) seconds or so.  What does it decay to?  The most rapid way that it can decay is via the strong nuclear force, which means quarks and gluons are involved.  The decay can be either to an unexcited proton plus a neutral pion or to an unexcited neutron plus a charged pion.  

If the pions&#039; masses were twice as big as they are, then this could not happen.  That&#039;s because when one object decays to two or more, the sum of the masses of the final particles must be less than the mass of the original.   https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/  , https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/
 
But in that case, the Delta (i.e. the excited proton) could decay in other ways.  For example, it could decay to an unexcited proton plus a photon --- quite similarly to a hydrogen atom.

These same principles govern atomic nuclei as well.  Stable nuclei can be put, by a sufficiently hard collision, into an excited state, following which they will decay.  Whether they decay rapidly or slowly, and what they decay to, depends very greatly on details; but they will always decay eventually.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In this write up we have a proton colliding with a photon, putting it into an excited state and then decaying to a neutrino and pion. How is such decay possible? Protons don&#039;t decay ( except rarely if certain GUT models are correct) and they certainly don&#039;t decay into a pion and neutrino which violates B-L charge. What gives?]]></description>
