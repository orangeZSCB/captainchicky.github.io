					<description><![CDATA[Dear Matt,

I&#039;ve been a long-time fan of your site for quite some time, and have read nearly all of the articles on it. I am a neuroscientist by trade but am increasingly interested in physics lately. You&#039;re probably asked this a lot, but because you&#039;re such a good explainer I respect your opinion on the matter: I was wondering what your go-to book recommendations are in the &quot;physics for a layman&quot; category. Books I&#039;ve liked have been Knowing: The Nature of Physical Law, The Road to Reality, and The Theoretical Minimum, the recent one by Susskind. Other good ones I&#039;ve liked have been Leonard Krauss&#039;s, and of course Feynman&#039;s. Weinberg&#039;s I&#039;ve also enjoyed, and Edward Witten has some good popularized stuff too. Just wondering if you had any particular &quot;desert island books for someone who doesn&#039;t know much calculus or linear algebra.&quot;

A followup question. I have a college physics textbook. It&#039;s about 1200 pages. Do you think I&#039;d get more value out of that alongside with learning the math involved for most of the classical physics material in there (which comprises about half of the text) than most non-math treatments of physics? Your writing actually gives me hope that one can attain a (comparatively) deep understanding of principles without much specific mathematical knowledge. I guess, because I don&#039;t know what I don&#039;t know, I can never really realize just what I&#039;m missing by not understanding graduate-level mathematical physics. Of course, when I&#039;ve dialogued with mathematicians who&#039;ve tried to explain to me in everyday language things like twistors, fibre bundles, Riemannian manifolds, it actually makes rather intuitive sense to me, I just don&#039;t really understand what the symbols mean and how it&#039;s all laid out in terms of equations that reference other concepts. Suppose this is a large issue, the whole &quot;how much physics can you grasp without math&quot; topic, so maybe you could riff on that for a second, although again, you&#039;ve probably done it before.

Thank you!]]></description>
