					<description><![CDATA[My experience with a Cuisinart bread maker was 
certainly not in line with my hopes for the name.

There were no boldly patterned skirts and I tried on dresses instead.
Most every resale piece will sell at a fraction of the original 
price.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations also to the scientists and engineers of Peru, who got the first Peruvian satellite named UAP-SAT-1 successfully into orbit on January 9, 2014. The purpose of this satellite is climate-related research, in particular meteorology. The launch vehicle was an Antares rocket provided by NASA, but the satellite itself was built in and is operated from Peru.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My congrats too go the various countries for further extending the frontiers of science. Particular outstanding was the last one about US. It touched me to the core. My own country Ghana bleeds because of petty partisan politics. What a day it would be when politics from different parties would push together for national good in Ghana!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In 2012, researchers claimed to have identified the path each particle had taken without any adverse effects at all on the interference pattern generated by the particles. In order to do this, they used a setup such that particles coming to the screen were not from a point-like source, but from a source with two intensity maxima ?

The predominant interaction of a gamma ray of energy greater than 10 MeV, as it enters the earth’s atmosphere, is pair production. The probability of pair production in photon-matter interactions increases with increasing photon energy. 

/&quot;I would be horrifically disappointed if we didn&#039;t discover dark matter,&quot; Rosenberg says. &quot;It is within our grasp, and I really want to know what it is.&quot;/

In a region of strong gravitational tidal forces, the two particles in a pair may sometimes be wrenched apart before they have a chance to mutually annihilate. When this happens in the region around a black hole, one particle may escape while its antiparticle partner is captured by the black hole.

Creation of relativistic bremsstrahlung and keeping the physical reality of uncertainty principle (quantum mechanical symmetry?) together, may cause the high energy photons to manifest Dark matter ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to you for getting quoted in Nature : http://www.nature.com/news/dark-matter-search-considers-exotic-possibilities-1.14459

 &quot;I doubt we’ve thought through all the interesting possibilities,&quot; says theorist Matt Strassler, a visiting physicist at Harvard University. &quot;We may get lucky&quot; and find the answer soon, he says, &quot;or this may drag on for 100 years or more.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“If the distance between the atom and the mirror is very small, it is physically impossible to distinguish between these two paths,” .

“The fascinating thing about this experiment”, the scientists say, “is the possibility of creating a quantum superposition state, using only a mirror, without any external fields.” In a very simple and natural way the distinction between the particle and its mirror image becomes blurred, without complicated operations carried out by the experimenter.

Yes Mr Patrice, only the mass energy become zero, vacuum energy starts prominance - because something is starts missing at this event horizon ?]]></description>
