					<description><![CDATA[Others do have some good points to make,
in a reasoned way because, after all, every place has its problems.
Whether it is Hulu or any other site, it is accessible.
This trick is a fantastic way to get access to the USA 
version of Netflix from Costa Rica without much hassle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Matt:

Sorry to be off topic, but this story has been all over the news in the last few days.  Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind proposed that black hole pairs could be linked by entanglement.  Is there any chance you might do a future write-up on this to flesh out this idea for your readership?

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant article, though for better picture and sound quality I recommend Facetime. I talk to my parents practically everyday from London to a small town next to a desert in the subcontinent (more than 4000 miles away) and to see them in HD makes their day and mine :-) future is already here, thank you Physics and thank you technology :-)

And unlike you sometime I do travel a lot across the globe, thankfully in the last five years it is easy to see and hear your loved ones wherever you are :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/12/03/the-fast-and-glamorous-life-of-a-theoretical-physicist/#comment-134720&quot;&gt;Oaktree (@Oaktree_)&lt;/a&gt;.

Time is merely a mathematical quantity (numerical order) of material change. In physical world, time is exclusively a mathematical quantity. In this sense mathematic is a part of physical universe. Temporal experience of material change ‚Äúone after other in time‚Äù is result of neuronal activity of the brain. Imaginary numbers show up in space-time intervals when space and time separations are combined at near the speed of light, and spatial separations are small relative to time intervals. 

&quot;Time dilation&quot; is a physical reality because, of the speed at which our body ages and the speed of light is constant - so &quot;rest mass&quot; is a relative order ? 

Thanking Mr.Oaktree and Mr.S.Dino and I repeat their opinions.
Professor Strassler has a jet on his own or not, his good soul worth billion $ - for providing platform.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One more issue.  Query how much different the speed of signals in modern international telecommunications equipment like wires and fiber optic equipment due to slower speeds of signals in these mediums than light in a vacuum and due to non-straight paths from point to point, differs from the speed of light.  This is still observably better than the speed of light trip from the surface to a communication satellite and back the the surface not through wires or fiber optic or switching in nearly straight lines with satellite phones, so it can&#039;t be that much of a degregation, but is it 1% less than the speed of light, 5%, 10% or 50%? 

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_electricity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;speed of electricity in unshielded copper wire&lt;/a&gt; is 3%-5% worse than the speed of light, (coax cable used by cable modems is about 34% less than the speed of light) but fiber optic makes up a lot of the main connection routes and is  similar or better than copper wire in this regard but still not speed of light in a vacuum.  Also, there are indirect paths (perhaps as much as a third worse than a straight path), and there are switching/intermediate booster   equipment delays too (fewer in fiber optic systems than copper wire systems).

In practice, Skype, etc. may be operating at something closer to 80,000-,140,000 as the crow flies miles per second, rather than 186,000.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A scenario in which a few seconds have to elapse between asking a question and transmitting a response sounds like a blessing to my ears and recalls the days well into the 19th century when businesses in urban centers received several mail deliveries per day and a correspondence of six or eight letters might be exchanged in a single day (you actually see these quoted in old court cases) much as we do by text message and e-mail now.

This is to my mind quite a bit more civilized than telephone communications and Skype where someone can presume to impose upon you whenever they choose to communicate with you whether you are inclined to interrupt whatever you are in the middle of doing or not.

This is also as good of a place to note that high speed long distance communication actually dates back to at least as far as the Bronze Age.  The concept is familiar to Lord of the Rings movie fans - where a network of bonfires on hills are lit to give notice to the next station down ten to thirty miles down the road who then pass on the message which as a pre-agreed meaning.  In England, this system of hill forts and cleared sight lines was the original purpose for which England&#039;s Ley Lines were constructed.  A similar system is historically attested in China where the &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; fable involves a princess who sounded the alarm with that system one time to many.  Native Americans in parts of the U.S. used &quot;smoke signals&quot; in a similar way.  Done well, such a system can send messages at about 30 miles per minute (1800 miles per hour), which while not even 186,000 miles per hour, is still quite competitive with any form of courier (even by modern supersonic planes).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, on Earth the speed of light is effectively infinite. But out there ‚Äì out among the stars ‚Äì it is pathetically slow. You may all accept it, and many of you embrace it, but I refuse. I know about the countless experiments that verify c as the ultimate speed limit ‚Äì and still I refuse‚Ä¶

Somewhere, somehow ‚Äì right now ‚Äì a starship executes an impossible turn and then accelerates at 1000g (while its occupants only experience ~1g). In less than a day the ship blows through the ‚Äòultimate speed limit‚Äô of 20th Century physics, leaving it far behind‚Ä¶

Amidst the great din you wonder at the eerie silence ‚Äì not realizing it is by carrier pigeon ‚Äì not carrier wave ‚Äì that the commerce and communication of the heavens precedes. 

‚ÄúAh Dino, you silly dreamer, you have no proof.‚Äù  You are right, in this matter, only faith‚Ä¶]]></description>
