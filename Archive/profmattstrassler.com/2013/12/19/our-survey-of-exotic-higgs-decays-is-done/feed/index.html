					<description><![CDATA[I seldom comment here since, while my business was quantum chemical physics, and am very well read in relativistic high energy physics, seriously studying the math, I&#039;m  absolutely not an expert. 

The comment is: it is a remarkably accessible paper. I actually understand it, congratulations on writing clarity!]]></description>

In a sense, yes; it stems from having an upper bound on how strongly the Higgs can interact with the W and Z particle, which is associated with the fact that the W and Z, in a unitary theory, are getting all their mass from the Higgs field (or fields).  If you want to have the known Higgs particle decay 99% of the time to exotic things, yet have its observed decays fit the Standard Model to 20% or so, that means you have to produce it 100 times as often as we expect.  That requires the coupling to gluons be very large.  That would in turn increase the relative rate at which the Higgs should be decaying to gluons (which we can&#039;t observe) and reduce the relative rate at which the Higgs is observed to decay to W and Z particles (which we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; observe), and you can&#039;t increase the coupling W and Z particles to compensate.  So at some point you just can&#039;t fit the data anymore.]]></description>

This is obtained by fitting the strengths of the various types of interactions to the data.  You&#039;d have to play very, very fast and loose to get anything more than about 60%, and even that would be pushing very hard. A more reasonable upper bound on the fraction of decays that are to exotic particles is probably 20%.]]></description>

Is this based on some kind of unitarity argument?]]></description>

Thanks. I quickly glanced at 1.1 and found (to my great surprise!) the sentence
&quot;We know the mass of (at least one) Higgs boson, and we also know that its branching fraction into exotic states cannot exceed  60%. &quot; Do I understand it right that at least 40% of decay is into known particles and at the most 60% into exotic particles?]]></description>
