your comments display a certain Victorian Hysteria. &quot;mislead&quot; can also mean to lead in a wrong direction, without any inference of lying.
  
Aristotle did lead the western world.into a serious error regarding physics, and it persisted for thousands of years. anyone who looked could have seen that his assertions were false.]]></description>

You have a great deal of patients professor... phyc patients! no of.course I mean patience. your students are very lucky...
  
do they often tell you.&quot;You are however, an idiot when it comes to the history of western civilization &quot;?? and do you mark them down for it?]]></description>

ou people is wierd. when I saw 139 comments I thought to myself.. wow lots of.good.interaction in the comments... instead I find you and a collection of cranks spamming the thread.

as a layman, I read a few hep and theory blogs to keep up with developments...  and even I can tell the cranks when they type out thier screeds. you sound like creationists in an evo devo blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thankyou Professor, 
there is no distinguish between proton and neutron. Difference is, we can manipulate the charge(+ve) in this nucleon cloud as proton. 
And most of that mass comes from the chaos intrinsic to a proton or neutron — from the motion-energy of a nucleon’s quarks, gluons and anti-quarks, and from the interaction-energy of the strong nuclear forces that hold a nucleon intact. --  https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/]]></description>

Charge does not equal mass.  Neutrons and protons have almost equal mass; neutrons have no charge, protons do have charge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Charge = mass = energy
If we increase charge, mass increases = no invariance.
For invariance, guage fields (quantized) should be massless. The connection between imaginary field and real field need speed of light as constant - otherwise, it is conformal invariant ?]]></description>
