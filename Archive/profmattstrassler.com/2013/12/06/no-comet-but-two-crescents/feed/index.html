					<description><![CDATA[I read another prrof  that venus orbits the sun

http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/tj/v15/n2/geocentrism

The full set of Venereal phases can happen only if Venus passes both in front of and behind the Sun as seen from Earth (Figure 1, left). The Ptolemaic model placed Venus orbiting the Earth closer than the Sun, but always near to the Sun as constrained by observations, but that would preclude gibbous phases from being seen since that would require the Earth to be roughly between the Sun and Venus. On the other hand, moving Venus’ orbit beyond that of the Sun would allow gibbous phases, but would not permit crescent phases to be seen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello there, just became aware of your boog through Google, and 
foundthat it is really informative. I&#039;m gonna watch out for brussels.

I&#039;ll be gratteful iff you continue this in future.

A lot of people will be benefited from your writing.
Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link.

In the experiment described therein, the hole through the source masses functions more as a means of conveniently moving them with respect to the test masses than as a means of measuring gravity inside them. Some tests of the inverse square law involve measuring gravity inside source masses by delicate suspension mechanisms.

Dozens or hundreds of gravity experiments have been done by measuring the tiny deviation of suspended masses compared to the lack of deviation when the source masses are removed. 

What has never been done is an experiment in which the dominant gravitational effect is revealed by allowing test masses to move freely through the center of source masses. That is the essence of the experiment proposed by Galileo.

Note that the general relativity (GR) prediction (which may be derived from the Schwarzschild interior solution) can be thought of in terms of clock rate. The Newtonian oscillation prediction corresponds to the GR prediction that a clock at the center has a minimum rate. This evokes the question, why should a clock at the center of the source mass tick slow? What makes that happen, if it does? By symmetry, and by analogy with rotation, for example, one might expect the central clock to have a maximum rate (as a clock on the axis of a rotating body has a maximum rate).

We could debate and compare analogies and predictions forever and never really know the answer until someone finally sees fit to do the experiment.]]></description>

Here is an experiment that is a little bit similar to what you describe: http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0609027
It is a measurement of the gravitational constant G where the test masses were suspended through holes in big field masses. It is quite interesting to read which experimental pains were taken by the authors to improve the accuracy. Still the obtained precision is nowhere close to the precision of measurements of other physical constants. The extreme weakness and the universality (i.e. no shielding possible) of gravity make it incredibly hard to measure. In fact the latest measurements of different groups are not in agreement. An interesting story, although the most probable explanation are unknown systematic errors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact that Galileo perceived the likely correctness of your graphic of Venus orbiting the Sun is one of the reasons he is regarded as the father of modern science. Your recommendation to see for yourself instead of believing what is written in books further echoes the ideals of science.

In this vein, I&#039;d like to mention another observational idea proposed by Galileo which, however, has NEVER been carried out. Galileo pondered the result of dropping a cannonball into a hole through the center of Earth. Though impossible to carry out on such a large scale, the idea is nevertheless quite possible to carry out in a satellite or an Earth-based laboratory (with a modified Cavendish balance).

Books tell us that, according to both Newton&#039;s and Einstein&#039;s theories of gravity, the dropped object harmonically oscillates in the hole. Karl Schwarzschild, who derived the most famous solution of Einstein&#039;s field equations---the EXTERIOR solution for a spherical mass---also derived an INTERIOR solution. This represents the most ponderous half of the gravitational universe. But the solution has never been tested. Performing Galileo&#039;s experiment would serve as a test.

Why believe the book answer when we can find out what happens by the direct observation of Nature herself? All we need is an apparatus that may be called a Small Low-Energy Non-Collider.]]></description>
