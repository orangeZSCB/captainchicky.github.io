					<description><![CDATA[@ Dave

Your comment is not to the point. The question is whether or not the electron&#039;s charge is constant irrespective of its orbit, its distance to the nucleus. 

BTW, I have the same question with regard to an electron&#039;s energy (mass).]]></description>

Martin you are very confused. Electrons all carry a single negative charge. In atoms electrons are arranged in atomic orbits which are termed s, p d and ultimately f. Irrespective of the atomic orbital each electron can only have a single negative charge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could there be an even lighter Higgs boson than the one they found?

Is the Higgs a &quot;real&quot; particle, in the same definition as the one we can &quot;see&quot;, or is it a process in which particles get created? A transition between nothingness (zero point energy) and resonances. 

I suppose you can rephrase the question by how does the Higgs mechanism tie in with supersymmetry or symmetry breaking? 

We don&#039;t know what a black hole is and hence we don&#039;t know how many different types of black holes exist and/or can be created. Can be due to a collapsing stars but could it also begin by creating WIMPs? A runaway reaction of the creation of a space consisting of WIMPs and growing very rapidly cancelling particles as it grows. Could WIMPs be antiparticles of Higgs bosons? I am not trying to contradict myself by inferring the Higgs as real, but rather, in order to maintain supersymmetry a state exist to counter the creation of real particles.

Can the LHC create WIMPs?]]></description>

As I understand it the charges of electrons in higher orbits are higher than the charges of electrons in lower orbits.]]></description>

You&#039;re confused, for some reason; they both become weaker with distance, like 1/(distance)^2.  Coulomb&#039;s law, versus Newton&#039;s law.  

No forces get stronger with distance.  A confining force is the best you can have, and that becomes constant with distance, like the tension on a string.]]></description>

I just wonder whether there is a connection betwween gravity getting weaker when distance grows whereas f.i. electromagnetic interaction force gets stronger when distance grows.]]></description>

What do you mean?  Gravity is by far the weakest known elementary force -- you can lift you arm easily with electromagnetic forces despite the gravitational pull of the entire earth.  Am I not understanding your question?]]></description>
