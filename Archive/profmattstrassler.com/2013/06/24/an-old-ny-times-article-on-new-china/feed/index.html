					<description><![CDATA[The freedom of human beings to do what their heart tells them they should do is what America should be about.  If we worry about how many &quot;stem&quot; people we produce, then I think our priorities are kind out of whack.

I know logically there&#039;s an argument to be made that we need more people going into science and engineering, but really I just don&#039;t care.  We need people going into what they&#039;re passionate about.  If that&#039;s parks and tourism instead of chemistry, then I&#039;m fine with that.  If we lose our dominance in technology, I&#039;m fine with that too.  It doesn&#039;t matter to me how many engineers can be summoned in 15 days to do something.  The only thing that matters to me is that in this country, people are allowed to purse what their heart tells them to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that Mr. Gong is not being wholly honest with those whom he chooses to lecture on Chinese history and culture when he fails to mention that China&#039;s &quot;five thousand years&quot; (sic: Chinese history does not actually extend back much more than about 3200 years, though this is still a very long time) of &#039;stability&#039; includes multiple cycles of dynastic decline, internal disintegration, civil war, foreign invasion, and division of the country; the end of the last such cycle being still within living memory. Nothing exempts China from the usual economic and political trends that affect other countries, and to pretend otherwise is simply nationalistic mythmaking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/06/24/an-old-ny-times-article-on-new-china/#comment-66147&quot;&gt;Kudzu&lt;/a&gt;.

Kudzu:&quot; ... according to Ro Khanna, former deputy assistant secretary of commerce, American workers are six times as productive as Chinese ...&quot; 


How sad this is for reading this type of nonsense. &quot;Ro Khanna, former deputy assistant secretary of commerce&quot;, a big wheel, so his statement cannot be wrong!!!  


Matt is a theoretical physicist who believes only the test data. And, this issue can be easily tested. Randomly select 10 workers from each country. And, they are sent to the other country sitting right beside the other country&#039;s 10 workers (in whatever type of production situation). One month will be long enough to know which group of workers is more productive. My guess is that the two groups will be about the same.


There are some cultures which do not promote the quality of diligence, but not the Chinese culture. Chinese workers can be much less productive if they are given much less productive system to work with. Thus, if the report said that American &quot;system (not worker)&quot; is six times more productive than Chinese &quot;system&quot;, it can possibly very true. Yet, this possibility is easily crushed by the Apple case. Was Apple either stupid or as a traitor for intentionally giving other country with huge amount of money from its “own packet”, that is, intentionally losing the profit. 


How can any smart reader of this blog lost all the common sense while reading those nonsense report?]]></description>

I would note that according to Ro Khanna, former deputy assistant secretary of commerce, American workers are six times as productive as Chinese ones and 50% more productive than Japanese ones. http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-15/opinions/37111109_1_gary-pisano-job-growth-service-sector]]></description>

Of course China&#039;s economy will drift toward parity and global equilibrium: standards of living will bring millions of its citizens out of poverty over time. The problem is--and this is the unprecedented thing about China--moving about 800 million people into the global working class takes a little while if you do it one or ten million people at a time. From the perspective of our lifetimes, that&#039;s essentially infinity people willing to work 12-hour shifts.]]></description>

Matt: “Other countries are perfectly capable of catching up to the U.S. — Japan did it, Korea is close — and we should expect China to do so too, if it doesn’t undergo an implosion along the way. “

No, no, no.  Both Japan and Korea did not develop their own cultures. They are the offshoots of Chinese culture. Even every Korean is 5 times more productive than every American, Korea as a nation still amounts to not much. Japan is a bit better than Korea but still is in the same category. 


Genetically, there is no chance of any kind for both Japan and Korea to surpass America. 
There is another great Western fantasy, thinking about that China is on the verge of having a “implosion” always. Those dreamers do simply not know any of Chinese history and the “mentality” of Chinese people while acting as great prophets. They are simply wrong. The Chinese “culture” is very, very, very stable, after all being the “only” and longest continually lasting culture in the world for over five thousand years. 


Being not knowing what the exact weight that the West amounts to in the long history of our humanity is one of the biggest issue that the West must face. Being not give a damn about the other part of  the world because of the biggest ego will be the final killer. Big head alone can no longer win the game of today. America is now bottled up in a self-indulgent big-ego-cocoon and not seeking the best any more.]]></description>
