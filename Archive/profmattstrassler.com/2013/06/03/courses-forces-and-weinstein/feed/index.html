Professor, for somebody so well-versed not just in the rigorous technicalities of the field, but also knowledgeable about the history of 20th century physics, you really should read up on the history of Einstein and his relationship with quantum theory. The hostility against Einstein was real.

P.S. It is written by an established, academic theoretical physicist and not some charlatan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/06/03/courses-forces-and-weinstein/#comment-62002&quot;&gt;Kudzu&lt;/a&gt;.

True and false. Newton needed Thomas Hooke for may of his central ideas. Einstein&#039;s GR was really the brainchild of one man (yes Grossman introduced him to Riemannian geometry and the Ricci tensors etc., but ultimately it was Einstein who TAUGHT himself Riemannian geometry). Your critique is deplorable as it gives the impression that Einstein&#039;s fame is due more to hype than substance. Einstein came up with about 3/4ths of the major conceptual breakthroughs in quantum theory, and i haven&#039;t even touched on his other accomplishments. Yes, he became an international celebrity, but it was NOT in a vacuum and, with the clarity of retrospect we see that in many ways his fame was well-deserved. Please read some more, you sound very ignorant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s the best time to make some plans for the future and it is time to be happy.
I have read this post and if I could I desire to suggest you some interesting things 
or advice. Perhaps you could write next articles referring to this article.
I desire to read even more things about it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was wondering if you ever thought of changing the page layout of your website?
Its very well written; I love what youve got to say.
But maybe you could a little more in the way of content so people could connect with it 
better. Youve got an awful lot of text for only having one 
or two pictures. Maybe you could space it out better?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that everything posted made a lot of 
sense. But, what about this? what if you were to write a killer headline?
I am not suggesting your information isn&#039;t solid., however suppose you added something that grabbed people&#039;s attention?
I mean Courses, Forces, and (w)Einstein &#124; Of Particular Significance is kinda vanilla.

You ought to look at Yahoo&#039;s home page and watch how they create post titles to get people to open the links. You might add a related video or a related pic or two to get readers interested about what you&#039;ve written.
In my opinion, it could make your posts a little livelier.]]></description>
