Matt,
I hope you are writing this from a General Relativistic poiint of view, not Newtonian.  All the hogwash about balancing centrifugal and centripetal forces acting on something in orbit based on Newtonian gravity is 100 years out of date.  Describing freefall in GR terms is not only more accurate, it&#039;s a lot simpler and illustrates much more general properties of spacetime.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Mr.Kudzu, foundations of tomorrow was determined by civil wars? - Humans lost their belief in verbal Logos, and replaced it with &quot;mathematical Logos&quot; ?

Civil wars after Ming dynasty, cultural Revolution. Americans were rather cruel to one another during the American Civil War. The various civil wars in England are an even better example, with most of the participants having been Anglo-Saxons yet just about every civil war there was rife with wholesale slaughter, torture, and mass executions. They didn&#039;t target or spare people based mostly on race or ethnic identity. 

After The Thirty years war in Germany (1618 -1648), the conscious space in between the above fig, the quantum number &quot;n&quot; was concised in favour of numerical and axiomatic &quot;quanta&quot;. This idea of quanta was from Hermann von Helmholtz (on the conservation of Force 1847) - this was only the quantization of the amplitude. Actually the non axiomatic increases with n &#060; 0. 
But the Black-body radiation observed by Max Planck made it murky. To localize the reality, Gottfried Leibniz&#039;s (1676-1689) &#034;living force&#034; or Chinese &#034;life force QI&#034; helped as conservation of energy. 
&#034;Every quanta have discrete energy according to their frequency, more quantas more intensity, but same energy&#034; - was understood by Max Planck - became the &#034;h&#034;. 
Sometimes, numerology automatically predict bizarre things, Einstein&#039;s speed of the light &#034;c&#034; made it more human - but relativity was consistent with axiomatic- became the Dirac&#039;s &#034;h-bar&#034;. They tried to contain it with more Euler, Leibniz mathematics. Even Noether&#039;s theorem was Langrangian- to fix density function (position) - cannot fix if, n&#060;0.

Eventhough &#034;reality&#034; not justify ethics and morality, Accumulation of wealth justify every crime against ethics and morality - because of this numerological function !

Mr.Kudzu,
if everything is recycled, which part of the cycle is called &quot;progress and advances&quot; ?
If anybody own this part of the flat earth, they still think earth is flat - not civilized  with scientific reality ?]]></description>
