					<description><![CDATA[When you mentioned having lost the knowledge for making a Stradivarius, I recalled reading the article linked below.  Thought you might find it interesting.  Research monies are monies very, very well spent even if we don&#039;t always turn up obviously useful results.  And thanks for a wonderfully entertaining and educational website.

					<description><![CDATA[I am an engineer and wanna be physicist. This post appeared the same day I arrived in Shenzhen China.  This is the second trip I&#039;ve made here this year and my 6th overall.  Every time I come here I am amazed at how far China has come (and exceeded) the US, not only in many technical aspects but how they are doing business now.  I notice other people are commenting on how they are not going to worry because the US is still the leader in innovating new technologies.  Well, that used to be true but now most of the major powers in the US seems to be only interested in manipulating money and monopolising every thing possible via the IP faux-property system.  

Many engineer/inventors including myself are scared to death of some new idea being the target of a patent troll.  This first thing that has to be considered whenever a new idea comes to mind is will you get sued to oblivion by some predatory company that mostly exists to extort money from real innovators.  From talking to my contacts in other parts of the world they are saying it is much better to target products to other than the US because of the IP situation.  And this is just one of many areas where the US is shooting itself in the foot.  

As far as other business practices, in Shenzhen there are many electronic market buildings of 4 or 5 stories completely full of independent vendors selling every kind of component possible.  Anyone can walk in off the street and buy 1 to thousands of a part.  There is no discrimination or snobbery to the small buyer vs. the mega corp. like in the US.  That is one of the reasons I travel here from my rapidly fading  tech grounds in Texas where I live.  Also the people here are a joy to work with.  They want your business.  Whether you are big or small they will go out of their way to get it and keep it.  Sure there are many good people in US industry who treat customers the same way, but there seem to be many more who do not. 

 I&#039;ll just end with one more comparison and then shut up.  I mentioned earlier about the technical market buildings that dot the landscape here.  About ten years ago, I was working in San Jose (think silicon valley) and decided to go to as many tech market places that would let me in.  All the places I went to would probably fit in two of the buildings here.  Most were fairly small companies and most are now closed.  Compare that to Shenzhen where 2 or 3 of these huge market buildings full of thousands of independent supplier are opening every year.   It seems to me it is a lot easier to have a space program when you have an active growing technical and scientific based economy, instead of a zero sum (or less) economy based on money manipulation and patent extortion.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think it matters so much who hosts it; it&#039;s a world-wide project.  It certainly matters who builds equipment for it and who gets to participate in the data collection and analysis.  Of course it would be good for the US program to have the accelerator here in North America, but that&#039;s impossible to discuss right now, given the disarray and priorities in Washington D.C.]]></description>

Agreed. Whoever shouts the loudest gets the biggest piece of the pie. And there are some loud voices with entire industries behind them demanding cash. Science has to yell at the top of its lungs just to avoid being drowned out.]]></description>
