What is c?

Is it the exist velocity of energy when a spinor is broken, i.e. symmetry breaking? 

Since c is constant would that indicate that the smallest confinement of energy is the same size. Is there any relationship between the Compton wavelength and the smallest possible spinor?

&quot;... it would dramatically alter everything measured at the LHC. &quot;  would the measurements be different for one proton - one muon system as opposed to millions of proton bombarding each other? You would expect some cancellation of gravity vectors in the LHC, yes? Would the ideal collision (to get the maximum information) be between two protons, millions of times over?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The oscillation frequency of the standing wave is the quantum state - is the energy of the state - the energy level or times planck&#039;s constant. 
In electron this involve two fields with fliping chirality - one field interact with weak force another not but appear stationary(quantum mixing) ? 
This is called gauge invariance ? 
Energy level and gauge invariance occur only if there is angular momentum ? - so how via Higgs field&#039;s linear momentum mass could be shifted to electron ?]]></description>

Whatever is up with the proton&#039;s charge-radius, it doesn&#039;t have to do with space-time.  Gravitational effects are tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny.  10,000,000,000,000,000 times too tiny.  Nowhere near big enough to make a 3-4% effect on the proton&#039;s apparent charge-radius.  If gravity grew exponentially at short distances to a degree large enough to affect how muons and protons interact at these distances, &lt;strong&gt;it would dramatically alter everything measured at the LHC&lt;/strong&gt;.

&quot;So, is it correct to say that if there is only one particle next in line down, graviton, that the fermions and quarks are not fundamental but, indeed, they are composite.&quot;  No.  Your premise isn&#039;t right, and your conclusion wouldn&#039;t follow even if it were.

Renormalization isn&#039;t about infinities, and they aren&#039;t smoke screens; this was understood by Kadanoff and by Wilson in the 1960s.  You should renormalize even in theories with no infinities, and there&#039;s a good physical reason, which I hope I can figure out how to explain someday to the public, but it&#039;s not easy.  In any case, this is a difficult conceptual and technical point not widely appreciated, so I am sure you will find discussions of renormalization for the public which say otherwise.]]></description>

1. Since the muon is &quot;closer&quot; to the proton than the electron could the Casimir effect be more pronounced and is condensing the proton space-time further (4%). Should be straight forward to deduce the 4% number since it is the difference between a proton-electron and proton-muon iterations?

2. We know the force of gravity exist and as you mentioned is quite smaller that the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. So, is it correct to say that if there is only one particle next in line down, graviton, that the fermions and quarks are not fundamental but, indeed, they are composite. 
I questioned that it maybe quantum gravity because it seems like a gravitational force. You mentioned no since the magnitude of gravity is so small, but is it linear? Could the gravitational force rise exponentially as the two particles (ripples) come closer to each other?

Which brings me to a question that just doesn&#039;t go away every since I started studying this amazing science. We have been calculating and theorizing in the last few decades using &quot;renormalization&quot; to remove the infinities out of the equations, (those annoying smoke screens which we cannot see through). Well, could this be a case where it has caused us to missing the real phenomenon, as two ripples come closer and closer together the gravitational force rises to infinity, hence the Pauli exclusion principle, that the two cannot share the same space-time because they will never overcome the gravitational barrier?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amplitude carries the physical informationâ€”where a physical system follows simultaneously all possible paths with &quot;probability&quot; amplitudes for each path being determined by the action for the path(cause and effect - causality). 
In quantum mechanics, in the absence of &quot;cause(external force), the effect is quantized- means no integral calculations, only  differential calculations? 
So the angular momentum(physical effect) is also quantized at quantum level. That means, gauge invariance make polarization(angular momentum) also quantized making, global symmetry(linear momentum) is just a local symmetry(angular momentum) - the problem of of &quot;physical effect&quot; and creation of mass is solved mathematically - but in reality ? 

 While an unbound electron does not exhibit quantized energy levels, an electron bound in an atomic orbital has quantized values of angular momentum.]]></description>

It probably has, but was more excusable I think when science and philosophy were joined at the hip and &#039;God did it&#039; was a valid excuse. Possibly it&#039;s just postmodernism and the modern suspicion of authority but it seems to me the past few decades have seen &#039;ignore all contrary evidence&#039; become more valid as a debate strategy.]]></description>
