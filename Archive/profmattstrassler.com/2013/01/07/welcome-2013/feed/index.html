					<description><![CDATA[As I recall, you had previously posts about how LHC experiments had parked large amounts of data for analysis during the long shutdown.

Is this data going to improve the certainty of the Higgs-like particle measurements, or just more exotic searches?]]></description>

I don&#039;t know much about the negative temperature result; I don&#039;t know any reason to get excited about it, because it&#039;s not a theoretical surprise on the one hand (http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html) and also because I don&#039;t know that having it available it changes anything.  If there are interesting applications, that would be nice to know.

I have no reason to believe the Chinese group&#039;s result; it&#039;s a case where we already know the answer --- the speed of gravity is the speed of light, and if it weren&#039;t true to a good approximation it would screw up various tests of Einstein&#039;s gravity, including the Hulse-Taylor pulsar. In such circumstances it is easy to convince yourself you see a signal when in fact you don&#039;t.  And the methods used don&#039;t sound very reliable. Let&#039;s see if anyone can duplicate the result before awarding these people the recognition that they seek.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good to see you back, Matt. Do you think you&#039;ll be going over the recent achievement of attaining negative absolute zero temperatures? How about the Chinese measurement of the speed of gravity? I&#039;d love to see your thoughts on both of these recent studies.]]></description>

In my mind there&#039;s no such thing as &quot;overdue&quot; --- nature doesn&#039;t operate by a schedule.  The particles are either there or they are not, and they are either discoverable using current methods or they are not, and they will show up when we become sensitive enough to measure them.  There&#039;s no rule that says they&#039;ll ever be discovered at all.  But just as there&#039;s been gradual progress over the last few years, I expect we&#039;ll see some interesting progress this year on multiple fronts.  I&#039;ll try to write an article about this sometime later; too busy right now.]]></description>

It&#039;s too early to say... All of that data was collected in 2012, but most of it will be processed for the first time only in 2013 [indeed that was the whole trick to this strategy!] and studied in 2013 and 2014.    So we have to wait and see.  I have every reason to be optimistic, however.

In any case, you can&#039;t phrase the success in terms of an effective increase in *total* data.  What increasing the trigger rate allows you to do is keep a certain *type* of data you would otherwise have discarded --- it does not let you increase the amount of data that you were keeping anyway.  So really the question is: if we look at the data set that would have been discarded, but instead was kept using parking, can measurements of high quality and interest be made using that data that could not have been made otherwise?  The answer will surely be yes, so the issue is one of degree.  Maybe in 2014 we&#039;ll be able to analyze how much additional information we obtained from parking.  For many studies it won&#039;t matter, but in a few classes of studies, it should be a big effect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, do you have any idea how successful &quot;data parking&quot; and other data collection techniques  were successful in the end?

The total data collected for 2012 was 21.5\fb, and so it would be nice to know how this has been effectively increased though yours and other people&#039;s efforts.]]></description>
