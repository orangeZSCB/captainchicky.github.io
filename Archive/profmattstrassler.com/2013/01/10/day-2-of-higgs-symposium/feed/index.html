Yes Professor, it enter cul-de-sac at quantum field theory where polarization and electron positron parity from electrodynamics and special relativity gave masless known particles - and the entry of relativity(special) gave intuition to give mass through Higgs field - where general relativity has been confined to less intuitive notions of geometry in QFT - avoiding curved spacetime. Thus making the intuition of relativity(c^2), a simple mathematical logic without physical effect(quantum action) ?]]></description>

There is nothing non-local about the Higgs field; nor does it have anything to do with superluminal communication or gravity.   The equations that govern the Higgs field and its behavior are local equations, those of an ordinary special-relativistic, local, causal quantum field theory... of the sort taught to first-year or second-year graduate students in their first quantum field theory class.]]></description>

Thank you Professor, I must ask ony one question at a time. Iam not sensible to coin “non local, pseudo scalar Higgs”. I confuse....
Like in thought experiment, the cat is dead and alive simultaneously, Higgs field is in local realism(Principle of locality) and out of local realism - so pseudo scalar- actually it is non local and make Quantum entanglement(Superluminal communication), which supplement gravity(quantum?) without relativity ?
Iam unsure about its logics.]]></description>
