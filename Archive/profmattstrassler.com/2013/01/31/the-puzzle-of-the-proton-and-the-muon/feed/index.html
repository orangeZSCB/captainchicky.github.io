The *natural* line width of any transition is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state - in this case is would be the natural radiative lifetime for the excited state to relax to the ground state by emitting a photon. All transitions therefore have non-zero linewidths. Because lasers are stimulated emission of photons out of the excited states of atoms the frequencies of lasers also have natural line widths. You simple can&#039;t get a round that. So the experiment involves convolving one Gaussian or pseudo-Gaussian (usually Lorentzian for atomic transitions) with another and measuring the effect as a function of the center-frequency of the changing laser. Of course there are uncertainties. All of measurement science is about understanding and correctly accounting for those uncertainties.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;There’s a very low but non-zero probability that it is of great importance. And if it is, I personally doubt anyone has yet thought of the reason.&quot;

Matt, the problem is of great importance, and Nassim Haramein predicted it in 2009, based on an extension to Einstein&#039;s and Planck&#039;s theories.

Consider the n-body problem, and that analytically, only single proton hydrogen has been solved.  N-body problems are more difficult than single body problems.

Seeing how you have serious concern about the amount of calculations that need to be done to extract the proton radius form the data, how much more concern do you have about the LHC and their attempts to extract data from a 2 body collision of two protons?

I now have SERIOUS concerns about the integrity and accuracy of the Higgs boson work at #CERN #LHC.

					<description><![CDATA[Great blg here! Also your site loads up fast! Whatt web host 
are you using? Can I get your affiliate lunk to your host?
I wish my sife loaded up as quickly as yours lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey I know this is off topic but I was wondering if you knew of 
any widgets I could add to my blog that automatically tweet my newest twitter updates.
I&#039;ve been looking for a plug-in like this for quite some time and was hoping maybe you 
would have some experience with something like this.

Please let me know if you run into anything.
I truly enjoy reading your blog and I look forward to your new updates.]]></description>
