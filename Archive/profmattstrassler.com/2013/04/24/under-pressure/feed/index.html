Indeed, if the threat but not use stops the attack. But if I use the gun, if I shoot someone to stop an attack and deliberately intend to wound not kill I can be prosecuted.

A gun, when used properly is intended to kill (even injury could be considered part of this.) there are few other things I can think of that have that as their primary purpose without which they would be of trivial use.]]></description>

The local DA will have you for breakfast if that is your attitude. You use a gun to make the attacker stop, period. When the attack stops, you can no longer use deadly force. And if the attack stops without a shot being fired, so much the better.]]></description>

Indeed, anyone with sense will tell you, if you use a gun, be prepared to kill. It&#039;s nearly impossible to use a gun for anything else.]]></description>

So that&#039;s why Law Enforcement carries guns, so they can kill. Good to know. How about a knife? Kitchenware, weapon, or both?]]></description>
