					<description><![CDATA[Would some expert please answer my following Q :
What is the physical proof - if any - that cosmic constants , laws , QM rules , principles are contingent not necessary ?
This is not for argument , i really need the answer.....thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here it is very good -and important- for neuro-science to try to understand the electro-chemical correlates of those aspects of the mind , but it is grave mistake to reduce them to the E-CH. correlates ....here they commit category mistake similar to molecular biologists when they reduce the flower to its molecules then FLOWERNESS disappears completely...
We need to restore the feeling of wonder and awe ....this is an essential aspect of our human nature.
Feel the wonders of our material world , never reduce it to its building blocks , do not miss the forest for some tiny trees....for me Schrodinger equation represent such mental beauty that almost fill my eyes with tears of wonder.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This a point for reflection whereby Matt. may kindly elaborate a little.....
I read that Schrodinger`s equation was not derived by any math. analysis , as one great physicist said : it is all from the mind of schrodinger , it is really amazing that mind alone can &quot;&quot; see &quot;&quot; a mathematical relation as complicated as that ( just take a look at its solution just for hydrogen atom ) !! it remind me of idiot savages where knowing no math. whatsoever they can  &quot;&quot;see &quot;&quot;the square root of 12 digits or 20 digits prime numbers......
Reflect on our amazing mind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/04/25/higgs-workshop-in-princeton/#comment-60427&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

Sorry, I wasn&#039;t clear enough. I was just trying to  make a *semantic* comment about the word &quot;creation&quot; only.
If you talk about &quot;creation&quot;, it implies something was &quot;being created&quot; which implies there&#039;s &quot;a creator&quot; that did it. And that may lead you to think there *must* be a creator --- or some other transcendent explanation to the fact that we exist.
I do *not* know what lies behind the physical (if anything) and I&#039;m afraid we will never really know that (at least in my life time).]]></description>

Religion never kneels to any thing or else it is false religion , so please RH state what was said by the letter.........
You owe an apology to religion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was accused of not listening to other views , OK., RH. i am willing to listen to yours , when you say theory of evolution , what do you exactly mean ? we  creationists--- but without young earth or global flood or distortion of GOD`s creation by Adam`s sin---understand TOE as the explanation of the  undirected  march from atoms to mind , are we right ?  now as a scientific theory it must have a clear outline / concept of the kind of that explanation..
We are eager to hear your scientific outline view of generation of genomes , epigenomes , interactomes , gene regulatory networks , intrinsic cell behavior ....etc BUT A SCIENTIFIC OUTLINE  not just-so stories , might , perhaps , maybe , could have been.......
Believe me RH i am really want to hear your view and i will listen but of course i am not obliged to accept what is NOT based on scientific evidence...
Fair ? OK. , i am listening.]]></description>
