					<description><![CDATA[Mark &quot;Obviously that flare and associated CME were not Earth directed â€” otherwise, yâ€™all would have remembered it from its disastrous effects&quot; 

and yet more proof of Global Warming some may say.  (I had to get that dig in.)

But some winter nights in Alpena Michigan in the late 1940&#039;s were as spectacular as recent photos from Alaska. If you get a chance do not miss seeing the &quot;big ones&quot;. You will remember them.]]></description>

They didn&#039;t email me, now I lost the count.. 4 from ESA cluster.. joined by 5 Themis then 2 then 2 went to lunar orbit and became Artemis... Aww! I must renew my subscription :-D]]></description>

NOAA space weather forecast is valuable for satellite operators and earth based communication companies, but it&#039;s only for contingencies.. I wish there is a long term planning going on.

My GPS is still working, no plan to put the 24-satellite GPS constellation to sleep? Probably the 5-satellite THEMIS constellation will be working in the storm, poor satellites I wish they will be alright.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gaia got you with her dazzling light show. Gaia is like a girl who bats her eyes at you so you won&#039;t noticed her weakness or carelessness that she unwittingly showed and therefore need to hide it somehow by batting her eyes at you... a dazzling light show!

There is something terrifying about auroras, it means that the Earth&#039;s magnetosphere was breached and allowed tons of harmful CME particles to enter our atmosphere. Mars&#039; magnetosphere was weak and failed to deflect a massive CME that consequently ripped off its atmosphere. Anyways, Gaia advocates say it&#039;s alright, she is just sampling the &#039;pathogens&#039; so she can manufacture appropriate defences... Like a mother that instinctively kiss her dirty baby to sample the pathogens so she can manufacture anti-bodies and incorporate it in her milk... to raise the immunity of her baby. So it&#039;s alright auroras reached new york?

The sun sneezes from time to time and we called it CME and it annoy the neighborhood. Our magnetosphere is like a handkerchief that we use to cover our noses when somebody sneeze.. never mind the Gaia advocates, I think our handkerchief is inadequate what can we do about it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ricky, twitter the guy,  I am sure he&#039;ll come up with something relating the two . . .  ;)

Minute-by-minute updates of magnetic field at Boulder, CO (and Kp index)

It&#039;s another inaccu-weather forecast, what did you expect?]]></description>
