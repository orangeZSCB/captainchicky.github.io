					<description><![CDATA[Very good blog you have here but I was wondering if you 
knew of any user discussion forums that cover the 
same topics discussed here? I&#039;d really like to be a part of group where I can get advice 
from other experienced individuals that share 
the same interest. If you have any suggestions, please let me 
know. Many thanks!]]></description>
