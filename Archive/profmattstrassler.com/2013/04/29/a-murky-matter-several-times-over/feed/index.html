I never cared one way or another regarding SUSY WIMPs myself; but there are lots of other ways to get dark matter.  All you need is a single new symmetry, and a single new neutral particle, one that is stable because of that symmetry and has the right interactions with itself and with ordinary matter.]]></description>

300 comments saying exactly the same thing is enough, Mr. Brown.  I&#039;m bored with this set of statements, with which you&#039;ve flooded my website.  We all know that MOND is a possibility, one that most experts disagree with, but which hasn&#039;t died yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;All of the dark-matter search experiments are difficult ...&quot; MOND might entirely eliminate the dark-matter hypothesis.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/04/29/a-murky-matter-several-times-over/#comment-57714&quot;&gt;ohwilleke&lt;/a&gt;.

My line of questioning points to the graviton and/or a heavier Higgs boson  or both ... ?

Dark matter not only prevents galaxies from flying apart from each other but could also be the dominate factor of keeping them intact. Interaction between &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;visible&quot; matter is there it is just to small (unit or quanta) for us to measure. But we can deduce the bigger picture. So what better particle could do this coupling other than the graviton?

Gravitons are small and fast but the total is 5x more (and suspect the ratio is not a random number either). Keep in mind that has nothing to do with mass, but rather energy and momentum.

In other words, the question could be posed like ... are graviton or more accurate, the gravitation field responsible for quantum confinement? Are infinite arrays of gravitons responsible for creating the walls that keep massive particle &quot;trapped&quot; and stable?]]></description>

The next naive thing would be to complement this with (something like)

Particle Interaction(s) symmetry group

Gimp Gravity SU(0) (= do nothing)

Neutrino Gravity, Weak +SU(2)

Electron Gravity, Weak, Electromagnetic +SU(1) (:=U(1))

Quark Gravity, Weak, Electromagnetic, Strong +SU(3)

and we see that we have a problem putting this in the right order 0,1,2,3 but then 1 and 2 are broken anyway :-)]]></description>

1.  The hypothesized low cross-section of interaction of dark matter is more relevant than its mass.  Dark matter is, by hypothesis, much heavier than neutrinos (otherwise Planck would observe more effective neutrino species and there would be no galactic structure), but the direct detection of neutrinos is something done routinely because they have a sufficiently great cross-section of interaction.
2.  Unlike the Higgs boson which has a lifetime of a fraction of a second, dark matter (or at least the predominant form of it) is stable or meta-stable.
3.  Hypothetical gravitons have zero rest mass and hence always move at the speed of light.  The dark matter hypothesis requires a particle that is not relativistic.]]></description>
