					<description><![CDATA[At the absence of tribal societies and religion, Europe restored to Experiments and rule of law- present grammars of physics. Einstein not formulated relativity - he only connected relativity to speed of light, because without visible light human consciousness have no meaning, context experiments. 
Without speed of light we lose our balance of symmetry(3D) in our piece of universe. For proofs beyond that, we must go to different parts of universe. 
Any simple knowledge of Hinduism and Buddhism, says little more than visible light and near to feeling &quot;ripple&quot; - Taoism make it more intelligence but remain as feeling &quot;The nature&quot; - &quot;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.&quot;  But these consciousness(ultimate truth) not lead to &quot;The science&quot; - only to diffrent symmetry without &quot;ripple&quot; or  simple harmonic oscillator - we can never understand the &quot;disturbance(mass, matter) in that oscillator ? Only experiments could illuminate that ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who was on the other side of that disagreement at the time, if I recall correctly, I think it was largely based on different uses of theoretical priors. I interpreted your stance at the time to be representative of the (healthy) perspective of an experimental scientist, who doesn&#039;t want to skew the interpretation of data with theoretical inferences beyond the absolutely necessary ones. Since I&#039;m not affiliated with any experiments, I think its fine for me to use more of those theoretical inferences when communicating the situation to a less-expert audience, particularly as long as I&#039;m clear that this is what Im doing. In this case that meant inferring that the Higgs discovery was more of a sure thing. But for someone involved with an experiment I agree it makes sense to keep theoretical inferences as circumscribed as possible. In practice, everybody involved should analyze the situation from both perspectives, at one level or another.]]></description>

Twenty years before I married, my wife was still an angel in her way to Earth, but of course, she was already destined to be my wife. This “horse is still dead” saying is simply nonsense. Yet, there is something worse than this dead horse. The new physics now is to combine the contradictory data to claim the positive identification of the Higgs boson, after all 0 + 2 = 1 in statistics combination.]]></description>

December v. July is tempest in a teapot stuff whose resolution doesn&#039;t matter one way or the other to anything of any consequence, even handing out the credit since the who is what matters for that, not the when, and the &quot;who&quot; is the same at either date.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing that brought my attention and interests towards science when I was little were stories about hardships of scientists in past times - how they were often wrong and how they fought to find and correct their errors. Stories about people going through numerous dead ends to find the treasure in the end.
I mean, it&#039;s ok by me for science to be wrong time to time. People should get used to the fact that scientists are only humans and they could be wrong or unsure about something. I find the uncertainity much more exciting. Moreover, people already forgot how to work with uncertainity because of science giving &quot;certainity beyond all doubts&quot; or no results at all way too often. 
World is getting categorical. Either it is a new particle or there is no particle. Either there will be an earthquake, or there will be no earthquake. Either it is radioactive (run!) or it is not radioactive (safe). 
Expert teams withholding their results because they are not sure about them are not exciting. They are boring. And they just add up to the trend and help the world to become even more categorical.]]></description>
