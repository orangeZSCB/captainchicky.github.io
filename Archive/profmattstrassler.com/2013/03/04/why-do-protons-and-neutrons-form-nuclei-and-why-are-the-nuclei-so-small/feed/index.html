					<description><![CDATA[It can be substantially and definitely improved: electrons, positrons, quarks and antiquarks are the two-photons-whirls. Mass is the measure of coupling of elementary energy (the photon) and epsilon and mu properties of the space - it is the convolution of elementary EM-energy and epsilon and mu. The photon&#039;s mass is non-inertial (proto-mass). The elementary inertial mass is the mass of the two-photons-whirl. The fundamental pattern of existence is:
a) energy-space-time, interrelated with the two most basic equations of existence: Planck&#039;s equation, Maxwell&#039;s equation for EM-velocity
Energy, space-time are essentially EM phenomena, which (can) change continually.
b) Fmax, c (the essential constraints)
c) 4 substantial interconnection values: Planck&#039;s constant, gravitation-constant, epsilon, mu
d) Gaussian and convolution
e) photon and two-photons-whirl

Confrontation of photons causes the increase of epsilon and mu properties of space in the area of their confrontation. Non-constant distribution of epsilon and mu causes the photon-path bending (that is why photons bend their path when they enter into prism, when they pass near the edges of solid bodies, when they pass through slits, ..., that is why interference patterns emerge when two coherent EM waves confront. That is also why light bends in the gravitational field).

From just Planck&#039;s quantum equation, and Maxwell&#039;s equation for EM propagation velocity, and from continuity-property of elementary energy and space-time, one can easily derive Newton&#039;s principles, and - including the superposition principle - one can easily derive the Newton&#039;s law of gravitation, and the correct relativity equations (current relativity equations are just approximations of reality, and that can be easily shown, mathematically precisely and irrefutably).

This is, essentially, the TOE core. In short. In words. There is also the complete mathematical derivation. Logically, mathematically and physically non-uncertain, non-spontaneous and unambiguous. In a word - irrefutable.
And therefore, very, very undesirable by the physics academic community.

Current science is as good as Ptolemy&#039;s description - rather precise description of the world, but driven with uncertainty, spontaneity, ambiguity, or, in other words, by God&#039;s will. So, current fundamental physics is just the mathematical mysticism. Mathematical religion. No-science.

Cheers!]]></description>
