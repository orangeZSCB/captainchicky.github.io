The methods have not changed much if at all (they&#039;ve been using multiple methods from the beginning, as cross-checks.)

What changed most (but not very much -- we&#039;re talking less than 1%) was the calibration data which goes into all of photon energies in all of the events that they are using.  When they measure the photon energy, they need to know exactly how each part of their calorimeter (i.e. energy detector) is working, in order to get the right number.  This is the trickiest (and most central) part of the measurement; you derive the mass of the particle that could have created the two photons (and most of the time they are created some other way) from those photon energy measurements.  Now, when you have a very large amount of background, and a very small amount of signal, a relatively small shift in calibration at each point in the detector, which will cause each event you&#039;ve measured to move slightly to the right or slightly to the left in your plot, can cause a small bump in the data (i.e., the Higgs signal) to grow or shrink, depending on what happened to the background that lies underneath it.  When this happened to CMS this fall, the effect was larger than they naively expected, and some people worried that an error had been made.  It took them some time to convince themselves that no, they had not made an error, and yes, the effect, though larger than it might have been, was not larger than was reasonable, given the uncertainties they had quoted originally back in July.  So having convinced themselves of this, they set out to do analyses on the full data set.  And the result of this analysis is what we have now seen.

According to the experts in CMS, they decided on their method before they did the analysis, and they stuck to it.  The results that we now see are not cherry-picked, they claim; they made the decision first, then studied the data, and presented the results based on their pre-analysis decision.

When you say &quot;I would have appreciated a better communication by CMS/CERN to the outside world about statistics verus method&quot;; (a) it&#039;s not CERN&#039;s job, it&#039;s CMS&#039;s job, and (b) the communication to scientists hasn&#039;t been that bad.  They did present some of the relevant numbers, though maybe not all of them.  

The problem here is all political and not scientific; they are now being accused of not having had enough signal to claim discovery back in July, by some who would want ATLAS to get credit and CMS not.  This is just silliness.  The &quot;5 sigma&quot; criterion is arbitrary, and CMS wouldn&#039;t have been far below 5 in any case.  Furthermore, I am told the improved calibration that reduced the photon signal also increased the tau signal, which was low (as you may recall) back in July, and is now much higher, so the two effects would have partly canceled.  Meanwhile, one could raise questions about whether the misalignment of ATLAS&#039;s two mass measurements means that perhaps they too have some problems.  (I think it is likely to be a statistical effect, personally.)  And lastly, both experiments have been performing with comparable excellence, skill and quality.  To deny one of them credit based on the vagaries of statistical luck is absurd.  Obviously both of them now have strong evidence and can claim credit.]]></description>

The fact that an outcome changes with more data by a few standard deviations is indeed a normal statistical effect BUT only if the method hasn&#039;t changed! I have to admit that I&#039;m not well informed on the data analysis but as an outsider I would have appreciated a better communication by CMS/CERN to the outside world about statistics verus method, especially because it took them so long to publish the diphoton result. You already explained some issues in your answer to AB32 and that already clears up some things. Thanks Matt.]]></description>

Fair enough.  It&#039;s partly a matter of style; it&#039;s one thing to raise questions, and another to accuse people of incompetence or misconduct.  To say that we shouldn&#039;t trust CMS because their result changed by 2 standard deviations, while we should trust ATLAS because their result changed by less than 1 standard deviations, is to misunderstand statistics and uncertainty estimates.]]></description>
