I was told quasar but he may was referring to a high energy gamma ray that just dissipated with scatter into other particles, but he certainly not referring to a micro black hole.

I suppose the question is not so much about an eleven dimension universe but is it possible for us, homo sapiens, to start the process of dissipation of mass. This is in reference to the fact the energy of the now valid Higgs boson is so close to the unstable vacuum region, could we extinguish the fire that made us? 

Is it plausible that if the universe continues to expand it will not make &quot;Island Universes&quot; like DR Lawrence Krauss refers to, but indeed, the span between the galaxies will be so great that there will be regions of zero vacuum created and hence start the process of extinguishing the ripples.]]></description>

Professor, is there any substance to the &quot;vanishing quasar at the LHC?]]></description>

The statement is one of effective field theory; the Standard Model coupled to gravity works as an effective field theory as long as you understand what you can and can&#039;t compute, as given by the rules of effective field theory.  You can certainly compute how particles behave if classical gravitational fields are weak.  It&#039;s not true the equations don&#039;t make sense at all; they just have well-understood limitations, and you&#039;d better not try to calculate anything too precisely.]]></description>

Matt, Not sure what you are saying here.  The SM, and Quantum Mechanics in general, is fundamentally inconsistent with &quot;classical&quot; General Relativity -- all of it!  As soon as you have curved 4D space-time, it&#039;s equations don&#039;t make sense.  It&#039;s Special Relativity and its flat space-time (not &quot;classicial Einsteinian gravity&quot;) with which the SM is consistent.  That said, it&#039;s one of the conundrums we face as to why and how it works so well anyway.  And it&#039;s the common misunderstanding, from Newtonian physics, that &quot;gravity&quot; is due to &quot;mass&quot;, that confuses people into thinking that the Higgs and gravity must be closely related.]]></description>

This is one of the things to be concerned about, of course.  How good are our calculations?

Of course, the discrepancy between ATLAS&#039;s result and CMS&#039;s result can&#039;t be resolved by a shift in the theoretical calculation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There was a theory paper yesterday, http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3590 . They attempt to estimate some of the N3LO corrections to Higgs production in gluon fusion. The claim is that the cross section might be increased by up to 17% on top of the NNLO result. 

I don&#039;t know how reliable that prediction is, but at the very least it is an indication for the size of higher order corrections.]]></description>
