					<description><![CDATA[Hey I know this is off topic but I was wondering if you knew of any widgets 
I could add to my blog that automatically tweet my 
newest twitter updates. I&#039;ve been looking for a plug-in like this 
for quite some time and was hoping maybe you would have some experience with something 
like this. Please let me know if you run into anything. I truly enjoy reading your 
blog and I look forward to your new updates.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unquestionably imagine that which you said. Your favorite justification seemed 
to be at the net the simplest factor to keep in mind of.
I say to you, I definitely get annoyed even as other people consider concerns that they 
plainly do not understand about. You controlled to hit 
the nail upon the top and defined out the whole thing without having 
side-effects , other folks could take a signal. Will likely be again to get more.
Thank you]]></description>

you are confusing parity and helicity (and chirality too, most likely.)  You can read up on it in any undergrad text on particle physics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt

Possibly a dumb question, but I thought parity described whether the particle was left-handed or right-handed, i.e. which way it spins relative to its motion.  If it has no spin , how does it have a handedness?]]></description>
