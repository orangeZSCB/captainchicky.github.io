I found that mathematical expression being discussed in this blog in the article &quot;The Higgs FAQ 1.0&quot; you might want to go there and scroll down a few posts or use the &#039;Find in Page&#039; function of your browser.. typing &#039;Lev Okun&#039; will quickly take you there.

I know you like DNA, do you know that the entire 35 million books and documents in the library of congress could be encoded in a minuscule of DNA? The nerdy engineers at JCVI know that, but that&#039;s not their priority hence some other institutions are working on it and perhaps get around on losing their research files due to cell deaths and mitosis :-D]]></description>
