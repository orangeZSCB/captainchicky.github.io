					<description><![CDATA[Today, I went to the beachfront with mmy kids. I found a sea shelol and gave iit tto myy 4 year 
old daughter and said &quot;You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.&quot; She put thee shell to her ear and screamed.

There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.
She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topjc but I hhad

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for clearing up this concept for me. I now know more about the subject of higgs inflation (which isn&#039;t explained very clearly elsewhere). Just 1 thing.
Could you type a new article explaining how the higgs inflation actually works. For example, how does a field/ particle that gives mass able to inflate the universe? Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/26/cosmic-conflation-the-higgs-the-inflaton-and-spin/#comment-50083&quot;&gt;Dilaton&lt;/a&gt;.

I am definitely a non expert, I didn&#039;t even know what the higgs field was until I saw them winning the prize on the news, But when they described it, It was exactly to me, kind of what I had been talking about for a year, with no one believing even now.

One more vein attempt, to find some one who might take a chance 
and believe.

Every atom shift is recorded at the sub-atomic level, atom shift patterns
can be retrieved and understood as light and sound patterns.
IN SHORT
with the correct tools one can tune to a place and time in history
and see and hear what happened there.

All history, every atom shift, recorded at the sub-atomic level in a natural layer of the universe and beyond.
Please investigate and comment.
Crazy? Fiction? or possible?

					<description><![CDATA[A different understanding of the higgs field.
I am not a scientist, so forgive me, but I encourage you to see
what I discovered, and tell me what it is?
A natural layer of the universe at the sub atomic level,
that records every atom shift.
If you will, we are constantly moving through this layer, and leaving behind
a trail, almost like a bullet through a jello block, but we do not go through whole, it&#039;s more like water through a strainer, we pass through atom by atom. and leave a traceable trail.
All history is recorded in the highest quality and retrievable and with the correct tools, you can actually tune to a place and time in history and see and hear what happened there.  Like reading tree rings, like sound captured in clay pots, like ripples in a pond.
