					<description><![CDATA[I think Kaku is an interesting guy but agree with those that have stated that &quot;he is always wrong.&quot;  Although I am a skeptic of most all theories in modern physics, Kaku&#039;s ideas and theories in particular seem merit-less and almost laughable to me:  The Higgs as the god particle, and the Higgs as the cause of the Big Bang.

As Leon Lederman stated, he wanted to name his book &quot;The goddamned particle instead of the &quot;God Particle&quot; but his publisher wouldn&#039;t accept it. 

To start with IMO the discovered Higgs particle will eventually by shown to be an inconsequential and meaningless very short-lived particle in the overall scheme of the universe.  Again IMO the standard model, like the BB model, is almost entirely wrong. I also believe our present explanations at the quantum scale, at the particle scale, and the macro-scales of the universe are almost entirely wrong and that the correct answers are vastly simpler than any models presently known or advocated. 

Where I think Kaku is most humorous is in his unreserved assertions of the mechanics of the universe. Most responsible theorists often point to possible problems with the model(s) they are advocating and how it might be disproved. Kaku, on the other hand, usually implies likelihood without reservation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[IMHO, maybe it would be prudent to step back and let the data be analyzed, then the ones who are jumping to a conclusion will recant?

http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/march-2013/one-step-closer-to-the-Higgs-boson

&quot;...This particle is remarkably consistent with the Standard Model Higgs boson,&quot; says Andrew Whitbeck, the doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University who presented the CMS experiment’s measurements. &quot;There are still large error margins, but everything is lining up for the Standard Model. It&#039;s pretty spectacular.

Only time—and more data—will tell whether the physicists have really found the Higgs they were looking for.&quot;
