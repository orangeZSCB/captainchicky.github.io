					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/20/why-the-higgs-matters-in-a-few-sentences/#comment-162153&quot;&gt;Wouter Baes&lt;/a&gt;.

1) We have no idea why one field (and its particle) interact more strongly with the Higgs field than another --- and thus we have no idea why the top quark is so much heavier than the electron.  This is often called the &quot;flavor problem&quot; and it is one of the thorniest problems in particle physics.

2) Evidence that the new particle is a Higgs particle is now very strong indeed, which is why the Nobel rize was awarded this year.  For a slightly out-of-date summary, see https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, first of all, I really enjoyed reading both the initial post as well as the comments. I however have a question about how the Higgs-field works. I wonder wether it&#039;s already known why certain particles interact to a greater measure with the Higgs-field (and therefore &#039;providing&#039; it with more mass, for as far as I&#039;ve understood the matter) than others? 
I seem to recall this being one of many problems listed upon finding proof of its existence (although I was led to believe it isn&#039;t conclusive proof, since the observed energy peak merely allows for the Higgs boson to exist, and doesn&#039;t necessarily prove the Higgs boson to be there (126GeV, if I&#039;m not mistaken)).
Could you correct me if my assumptions are wrong and, if possible, provide me with an answer for my question. Thanks in advance

					<description><![CDATA[You write that there is evidence that the Higgs field interacts with the tau, and this gives some confidence that the same Higgs field must interact with the electron or else some modes of tau decay that we don&#039;t see could occur. (If I understand you correctly.) Does this reasoning also apply to the muon? Do we currently expect that the same Higgs field interacts with all three, the electron, muon, and tau?

Thanks for this site and all your efforts to explain these concepts!]]></description>
