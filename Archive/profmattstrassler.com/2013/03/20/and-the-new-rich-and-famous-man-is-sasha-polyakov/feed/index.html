					<description><![CDATA[On the centenary of Einstein&#039;s theory,it will be a breakthrough in Fundamental physics. 

UNIFIED FIELD THEORY  author CHAYKIN  on ﻿www.chaykins.ru 

In this paper, based on the uniform super fluid substance (vacuum liquid) is identical with the equations of the electromagnetic field and gravitational field.
These differential equations are corrected by the author equations of electrodynamics Maxwell:
1. Excluded vortex field, the electric field is always potentially.
2. Time-varying magnetic field is interpreted as a charge density offset and added to the real density of the charges.
For the successful application of modified equations of electrodynamics to gravity, enough gravitational mass to be considered as a gravitational charge, having the same dimensionality as the electric charge.
This weight is multiplied by of the gravitational constant of Newton in degree 1/2.
Gravity currents are conventional mechanical pulses multiplied by this factor also leads to a vertical gravitational fieldes, as in electrodynamics and with the same consequences......]]></description>

Define your terms.  I&#039;m in New York, where are you?  And what do you mean &quot;move the milestones forward for mankind?&quot;  

Polyakov has contributed very substantially to our understanding of how quarks and gluons become protons and neutrons in the early universe; of why and how protons and neutrons form at all; of the great puzzle known as the strong CP problem, which is what led to the idea of axions as a possible candidate for dark matter; of phase transitions in materials of various types; and much more.  Now if you don&#039;t consider understanding these various essential aspects of our world important, then of course you won&#039;t view the milestones as moved.  But we are talking about real things in our real world, not mathematical abstractions, and it seems to me that every step that humans take in comprehending the world around us is is a moved milestone for humankind.]]></description>
