					<description><![CDATA[Greetings from Carolina! I&#039;m bored to death at work so I decided to check out your blog on my iphone during lunch 
break. I enjoy the info you provide here and can&#039;t wait to take a look when I get home.
I&#039;m surprised at how fast your blog loaded on my phone ..
I&#039;m not even using WIFI, just 3G .. Anyhow, awesome site!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/#comment-67331&quot;&gt;el&lt;/a&gt;.

This is technical and not obvious, which is why Haber and Nir&#039;s paper is famous.  I certainly can&#039;t explain it in an entirely non-technical way.  You actually have to take the equations and show that this is how they behave.

There is a way to understand it intuitively, but that also is not trivial to explain without math.

But since this is such an important point for understanding what the LHC is doing and why particle physicists do not believe that the LHC&#039;s data shows that the Standard Model is necessarily correct, I will think about whether this can be explained without much math.  I can&#039;t see how to do it today, but I will try over the next few months to come up with something.]]></description>
