In that case he should have known better.  We would all love governments to do more for science (especially for our pet projects). But that is no reason why we should have to sound apocalyptic all the time.  One also expects scientists to focus more on ACTUAL FACTS and NUMBERS.]]></description>

Mr. Alberts is one the science envoys of the Obama administration, I didn&#039;t see his itinerary but I assumed he travels a lot.

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe Bruce Alberts should travel more widely around the world and also look at actual data. Then he will know that US in particular, and the west as a whole, remains the best place to live and work and to do research. Actaul data measuring the quality of science research (citations per paper) shows that US is continuing to hold its own, Europe has improved a lot over the past decade also, it is in fact in India and China where one can seen no improvement in quality and infact a deterioration in many cases

					<description><![CDATA[Funny that you bring that up Ervin:

I do not believe that applying the CPT theorem to General Relativity (GR) as Villata did is a valid approach to account for antimatter antigravity, should such exist, and I agree completely with the paper you cite by Daniel Cross (and others since then) that GR is simply not compatible with antimatter antigravity. If AEgIS does find antimatter antigravity then GR is NOT the correct theory of gravity.

Villata tries to maintain the validity of Einstein’s principle of equivalence along with antimatter antigravity by proposing that antimatter is time reversed relative to matter. This hypothesis was popular in the 1940’s (check the dates of Villata’s references in his paper!) before we were able to maintain the existence of antimatter for any extended period of time. Today, in an era where the existence of antihydrogen has been maintained for several minutes it seems clear that antimatter is moving in the same direction of time as matter (i.e. it doesn’t disappear into the past upon creation). Yet, much to my surprise, Villata’s theory has gotten a lot of traction.

In discussing this theory last year, a friend noted: “Maybe its nonsense Dino, but its tailor made for the ‘Einstein: Too Big to Fail’ crowd, an easy bail-out.  In case of emergency (AEgIS finds antimatter antigravity) break glass (rally round Villata’s CPT theory). This way they have all the bases covered. In fact Dino, should AEgIS find antimatter antigravity, don’t be surprised to read a headline: “General Relativity predicts antimatter antigravity”. The Devil himself couldn’t think of a better way to torture you.”]]></description>

It&#039;s about perspective, if the administration lacks it the collective efforts of  the people could impart it and consequently influenced the actions of the administration. Some prefer to do it under the radar, and some prefer to embarrass themselves with unsubstantiated statements.. but both are useful in achieving the objective. The highway bill was achieved in the same fashion, if there are more Mr. Alberts who are not happy with the infrastructure built through the highway bill, the people can influenced its modification, preferably people who know what they are doing.

Let&#039;s see how the BRAIN initiative will pan out, I&#039;m expecting the best. I could see lots of physics and chemistry in it more than biology. :-)]]></description>
