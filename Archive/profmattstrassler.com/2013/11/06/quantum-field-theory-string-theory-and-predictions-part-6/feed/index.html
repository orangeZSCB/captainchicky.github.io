					<description><![CDATA[Prof Strassler,
 Having recently discovered your blog, I have been slowly reading through your many topics.  Pedagogically i think they&#039;re wonderful, explaining &quot;more correctly&quot; than even some of Feynman&#039;s popularized explanations.

By profession &#038; training I am an engineer, but have taken introductory non-relativistic QM courses in the 1970s ... but never any advanced QM or QFT stuff.

My questions today are, &quot;WHAT is a quantum field?&quot;     ie, at each point in space &quot;what&quot; is it describing?   
And does it have some physical significance, or is it an abstract non-physical thing, analogous to the magnetic vector potential?

For classical vector fields  (eg,  an electric or wind velocity field), or scalar fields (eg, temperature), it&#039;s pretty clear what&#039;s being described as a function of position &#038; time.   But it&#039;s not clear to me what a quantum field&#039;s physical interpretation is. 

Forgive me if this has aready been asked and answered, with the 100s of comments I may have missed it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,

Thanks for these bloggs. It gives us non experts some insight into what&#039;s going on in these complex fields. My question is (sorry if its simplistic) when you talk of the quark masses going down to zero are you considering this in relation some modification of the Higgs mechanism (which I understand is responsible for imparting the masses in the first place) or its removal? ie whats the mechanism by which the quarks are no longer massive?]]></description>
