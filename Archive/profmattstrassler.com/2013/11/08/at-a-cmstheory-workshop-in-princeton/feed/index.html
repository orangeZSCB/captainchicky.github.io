Point being if you have infinite eigen states of these &quot;quantized pockets (volumes) of energy, but our math can only draw a set of finite points because we cannot &quot;see&quot; or deduce all, then we don&#039;t know the whole story. Much like a big puzzle and we have only a few pieces in hand and infinite missing.

My main point is quantization is necessary of our tools but is placing a limit to our understanding and even worst may lead us in the wrong directions and will be wasting a lot of time and careers.

Can we come up with better tools and/or better experiments and sensors? 

I hope they can finish JWST in my life time. :-)]]></description>

Hie Oaktree
Thanks for reading my paper. I clearly do not understand the question &#039;Did these processes lead to determine the natural eigen states or did they create the eigen states?&#039; 
Like I have mentioned before all I do is take a finite length of the space-time continuum, break it down into Fourier components and analyse them. In my paper the quantum vacuum and space-time are inextricably linked via the uncertainty principle. You could consider it as the equivalence of four momentum space and space-time i.e different sides of the same coin so one cannot exist without the other. The cosmological constant represents the lowest Eigen state (zero point energy) of space-time  therefore the vacuum does not collapse to zero.]]></description>

Hello Stuart, thanks for the link and a very interesting paper. I am always skeptical about the use of quantization techniques. Did these processes lead to determine the natural eigen states or did they create the eigen states? 

I believe our math is not sufficient to deduce the reality of space-time because it is only a best curve approximation regardless of the scale. 

If the gravitons or at such a low energy was prevent the vacuum from collapsing to zero? In other words since we lives in a universe of disturbances, oscillations, should there not be an external force that maintains the unstable space-time continuum? 

Can holographs be used the create the models of the various theories?]]></description>

@kashyap
Can you kindly look at the spin states that give rise to 0 spin bosons in my paper.Notice that each member of the following spin state pairs a) &#038; c) and b) &#038; d)   is related to the other by some mirror symmetry. Can this suggest  hints of a complex doublet? What is your take on that?]]></description>

Thanks a lot. The important thing like you said in your penultimate post is to&quot;.. link the four spin states to the known bosonic forces..&quot; Your contributions including Kashyaps&#039; are valuable will continue my research and consultations.Mucha gracias]]></description>

@kashyap
Of course you&#039;re correct, the scalar fields together form a doublet under SU(2). Instead of his papers I would recommend Stuart to read Weinberg&#039;s books on field theory but these are very advanced. The Higgs mechanism is very well explained in:
Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics
Ta-Pei Cheng and Ling-Fong Li]]></description>

@Stuart. Again no reply button on your last answer! May be webmaster is telling us to cut it out!! Any way, you may want to read Weinberg&#039;s papers, rather than just N.Y times article. It seems to me that this may be largely a matter of semantics in a popular article for general public. My understanding is that when he talks about four fields, he does not mean  four independent fields. These are part of a complex doublet (phi1...4) combining phi1+i phi2 and phi3+i phi4. Of course, I would not mind being corrected or over ruled!]]></description>
