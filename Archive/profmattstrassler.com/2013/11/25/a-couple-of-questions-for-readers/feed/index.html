					<description><![CDATA[I know this post is ancient, but FWIW here are my thoughts on why people are irrationally scared of radiation. My background is mathematics, so I&#039;m coming at it from that angle.

People know radiation is dangerous, and can cause cancer, or, in sufficient quantity, radiation burns or radiation sickness. Cancer is one of the most feared illnesses around, so that&#039;s part of it. But, really, I think the irrationality is driven by a failure to understand quantity, magnitudes, and powers of ten, and that this is compounded by our lack of ability to perceive radiation with our own senses, and by a lack of basic information about the amounts of radiation that occur in various contexts.

The best lay-friendly explanation I know of is xkcd&#039;s. A few minutes of perusing this post makes it abundantly clear that there are natural, everyday sources of radiation that we live with 24-7-365 without any harm: http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/03/19/radiation-chart/

However, even with this in mind, I&#039;m still mystified by people who have alleged that Fukushima radiation is damaging ocean ecosystems, or making fish unsafe to eat, off the Pacific coast of North America. Maybe these people also lack an understanding of how large the oceans are? Of how many millions of cubic miles of seawater are in the Pacific Ocean? It seems strange to me, but that&#039;s the conclusion I&#039;m led to: Innumeracy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Radiation is invisible, like viruses . . . but from all the evidence of recent history, we can take fairly straightforward steps to avoid the risk of infection.  Not so with radiation . . . we can&#039;t easily evade radiation leaked into the environment -- or so we believe -- and that makes it a much scarier threat.  It&#039;s also, potentially, a very long-lived threat:  the long-term containment of even relatively localized messes like Chernobyl and Fukushima seems to be beyond our technology.  
And there&#039;s the matter of the number of people put at risk.  A disaster that could injure or kill a lot of people grabs your attention, even if it&#039;s a very, very slight risk.    It&#039;s a bit like how the same people who worry about commericial airline crashes, which in a typical year kill nobody at all, blithely hurtle down the road in their cars without giving a momen&#039;t thought to the tens of thousands killed in auto accidents every year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/25/a-couple-of-questions-for-readers/#comment-138993&quot;&gt;Garcol&lt;/a&gt;.

1) Not directly, but that&#039;s mainly because the effect is so small, compared to the effect of smoking, environmental pollution, etc. that it would be very hard to detect it with reliability.

2) &quot;At least one peer-reviewed journal reports&quot; --- I can&#039;t judge, since I wouldn&#039;t be able to evaluate the study.  But I can tell you that until a study is verified by at least two groups, I don&#039;t believe it --- and that&#039;s in the context of particle physics, which is a lot easier to get right than is medical research.  There are a lot of bad researchers, and a lot of bad studies, in every field.  So I don&#039;t consider &quot;at least one&quot; very convincing... as I would not consider it convincing to see one study that claims there&#039;s no effect.  If we&#039;re going to make people terrified, we&#039;d better have better evidence.

3)&quot;“Between Japan and Hawaii Cs-137 values were measured that exceeded background Cs-137 by a factor of 2-3 and the southeastern leading edge of the plume traveling westward. These levels are not significant when compared with total radiation levels in north Pacific seawater.” Not significant? What is the lower level of no radiation damage? 

I can&#039;t respond to this either, in any precise way.  However, 2-3 times background of *caesium* does not sound like much to me... the issue is whether it becomes concentrated to a much greater degree, and what that degree is.  I agree that is the issue. And regarding &quot;What is the lower level&quot; --- there is disagreement about this, because the effect is so tiny that it is hard to measure.  However, our bodies have to cope with natural background radiation, so clearly we can handle a certain amount.  Why would it be that a tiny bit more has a big effect, when the natural amounts are something we can handle rather well?  I don&#039;t understand the logic... the issue is whether there&#039;s a lot more than the natural amounts.

But you know, you&#039;re being pounded by muons from the upper atmosphere every second.  And when you fly in an airplane, that number goes way up.  Why aren&#039;t you worried about that?  My point is that you&#039;re not using numbers, properly; you&#039;re just throwing them around.  2-3 times background caesium is nothing if the usual background is tiny compared to natural background radiation in total; it&#039;s a lot if the usual background is big.  Do you know which it is?  I will bet you do not.  And I don&#039;t either.  My goal is to change that. But the point is: you&#039;re just spreading stuff you don&#039;t understand, and that&#039;s not helpful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Much of this rationality about irrational fears is precisely what I thought this posting was to avoid. So here are three questions, which should lend themselves to non-philosophical, objective analysis:
1. Is there any way to extrapolate from the current levels of &quot;background radiation&quot;, what the mutation rate/cancer rate WOULD have been without all the nuclear testing and accidents of the past 50+ years?
2. At least one peer-reviewed journal reports that the incidence of childhood hypothyroidism in California, abnormal development of thyroid in newborns, can be directly related to the incidence of increased I-131 from Fukushima. Open Journal of Pediatrics, 2013, 3, 370-376 OJPed
http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/ojped.2013.34067. Can anyone comment on the report&#039;s validity?
3. Many comments here have likened the large amount of contaminated Fukushima water to be merely &#039;a drop in the bucket&#039;, as homogenous mixing in the Pacific would dilute the radioactive contaminants to &#039;far below their harmful levels&#039; (levels which are arrived at by short-term testing and statistical probabilities), but studies from Australia and NOAA/NASA have modeled contamination mixing in the N Pacific gyre which sources the Fuskushima contamination, which indicate prolonged non-miscibility and aggregation. (Marine Chemist seems to poopoo this observation, but I cannot locate any data on the Cullen website to confirm or deny. Marine Chemist: &quot;Between Japan and Hawaii Cs-137 values were measured that exceeded background Cs-137 by a factor of 2-3 and the southeastern leading edge of the plume traveling westward. These levels are not significant when compared with total radiation levels in north Pacific seawater.&quot; Not significant? What is the lower level of no radiation damage? (http://www.globalresearch.ca/fukushima-radiation-levels-will-concentrate-in-pockets-at-specific-us-and-canada-west-coast-locations/5356528) Between the current leak (assuming no further degredation) and a 10+-year window before homogenous mixing and dilution, there will be a 10-year period where contamination WILL be a major constituent of some areas of the Pacific; how can the sea life be told to avoid those regions for 10+ years?]]></description>
