					<description><![CDATA[IMHO there&#039;s an issue with the Higgs mechanism, in that there&#039;s no electron model in the Standard Model. Once this is in place people will appreciate that mass is the flip side of momentum, and that &lt;i&gt;if the Higgs field is responsible for electron mass, it has to be responsible for photon momentum too.&lt;/i&gt; So it&#039;s the photon field. That&#039;s the only way you can reconcile it back to E=mc². So what was discovered? 

Sean, I love your droll writing, I laughed out loud at your blog piece, but it might be an idea if you spent that money quick!]]></description>

We then find spacetime to have 1X 10^60 eigen states. The minimum energy =hH where h is planks constant and H the Hubble constant. The highest energy state is of course the planck energy. The minimum displacement in spacetime being planck scale spacetime and the maximum being the Hubble radius and Hubble time.]]></description>

If there is a minimum displacement in spacetime then via the uncertainty pricinple there is must be a corresponding maximum four momentum. By the same token if there is a minimum four momentum there must be a corresponding maximum displacement in spacetime.From here we find boundary conditions from which we apply canonical quantization procedures to find the eigen states of spacetime and the quantum vacuum]]></description>

@Kashyap Vasavada: The real understanding is different from yours - the boundary conditions dictate the region where the field is non zero. They (BC) are real. And those boundary conditions are our simplified solutions to the actual field-matter complicated interactions. Thus, it is much more correct to think of quanta (field excitations) as of quasi-particles in specific compound systems. The quasi-particle world is much more richer than the particle data group can imagine.]]></description>
