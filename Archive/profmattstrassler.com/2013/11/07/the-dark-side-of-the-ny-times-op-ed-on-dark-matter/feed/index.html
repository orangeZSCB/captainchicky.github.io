					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/07/the-dark-side-of-the-ny-times-op-ed-on-dark-matter/#comment-111488&quot;&gt;duffieldjohn&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi duffieldjohn. I&#039;m pleased to see here another contributor to Matt&#039;s blog that has good knowledge on the subject of gravity, relativity and spacetime.

There is one area regarding your comments that needs some clarification in my opinion. But first we should to be in agreement that the concept of time is something that derives from material motion. Assuming that is agreed, if motion is slowed from a perspective of one viewer because that motion comes from a region that has a stronger gravity than the region that viewer is in (for the sake of simplicity a clock on a planet with a solid surface and another clock at a geosynchronous orbital position. Both clocks are calibrated and when together tic at the same rate.) the viewer at the geosynchronous position will measure that the tics from the surface clock arrive slower than his own clock and visa versa the observer at the surface will find that tics from the geosynchronous clock arrive at a faster rate than do those from his clock.

Time does not not speed up or slow because of being higher or lower in a gravitational field, what speeds up or slows are the material things that convey time, and that is because all things seem to be affected by gravity, including photons.

I am more sympathetic to the following comment than I am to modern physics seeming or real regard of photon mass as being zero. In my view if something exists and has momentum it also has mass:

From Abraham Pais&#039; book &#039;Subtle is the Lord...&#039;: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein, p. 200:

&quot;I conclude this section by paying my respects to the German geodete and astronomer Johann Georg von Soldner, who in 1801 became the first to answer Newton&#039;s query on the bending of light [S3]. &#039;No one would find it objectionable, I hope, that I treat a light ray as a heavy body.... One cannot think of a thing which exists and works on our senses that would not have the property of matter,&#039; Soldner wrote.&quot;]]></description>

Yes, I’ve read the Baez article, and much more. And the important point is that spacetime is a mathematical space. It is NOT space, thus the “local curvature of spacetime” can be misleading. Space is not curved in a gravitational field. A beam of light moving between two stars isn’t deflected at all, the “deflection along the timelike axis” isn’t a deflection. That light beam took more time to cross the same amount of space, that’s all. And it didn’t “follow a path through spacetime”, it traversed a path through space. There’s no motion in spacetime, or through spacetime. It is utterly static. You can draw a worldline in it, but nothing moves in it. Not light, not falling bodies, nothing.]]></description>

“It took more time to cross the same amount of space” is exactly equivalent to “it crossed more space in the same amount of time”.


* Oops, it crossed less space in the same amount of time, of course.]]></description>

Did you not read that same Baez article you link to?

Space is certainly curved near compact massive objects, but that curvature is not equivalent to gravitation, it is caused by gravitation.
Gravitation is spacetime curvature.   This is said clearly three sentences after the one you quote directly.

The choice of coordinates decides whether to think of how the local curvature of spacetime couples to a test object.  In most conventional coordinate systems and metrics a slow-moving massive object passing close to the surface of the sun would be seen by a terrestrial observer as being deflected more along a spacelike axis than along the timelike one (example: Mercury, comets, and so forth) whereas a fast-moving light object (e.g. light, neutrinos, cosmic rays) will be deflected more along the timelike axis than a spacelike one.    

That&#039;s hardly super-surprising; one does not talk about the anomalous periodical redshift of Mercury rather than a delay in its &quot;return&quot; to (x,y,z,t&#039;) because its orbital distance is stretched; likewise, one more often talks about light objects in terms of phase anomalies due to gravitaional lensing because their frequencies are retarded.  (Gravitational lensing is a somewhat special case, however, where one wants to think about parallel transport in a sense of modifying the paths that light might take rather than the fate of two particles emitted at a given time; the emission sources are typically noisy in the frequency domain but have a well-characterizable average spatial distribution).

However, because of coordinate freedom, one can easily choose to think of the gravitational effects of passing near a massive object as being some arbitrary mix of spatial and temporal contraction, including all of one and none of the other.   &quot;It took more time to cross the same amount of space&quot; is exactly equivalent to &quot;it crossed more space in the same amount of time&quot;.

Wright&#039;s article (and some of your text above) contradicts your assertion: &quot;In similar vein light doesn’t curve because spacetime is curved&quot;.

Following a curved path through flat spacetime can be exactly equivalent to following a straight path through curved spacetime where the thing following is in free fall.   There is general freedom of choice there, too.]]></description>

I should add that what happens is that the concentration of energy tied up as the mass of the Earth &quot;conditions&quot; the surrounding space, altering its &quot;metrical qualities&quot;. That&#039;s what Einstein said, along with &lt;i&gt;&quot;a curvature of light can only occur when the propagation speed of light varies with position&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. Hence light-clocks go slower when they&#039;re lower, and light curves, IMHO like a car veers when it encounters mud at the side of the road. But even though relativists know that the coordinate speed of light varies in a gravitational field, you never read seem to read about this kind of thing in media reportage. So I&#039;d say things are even murkier than people think.]]></description>
