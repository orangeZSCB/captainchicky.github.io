Do you have any tips on how to get listed in Yahoo News? I&#039;ve been trying for a 
while but I never seem to get there! Thanks]]></description>

1) I believe that this is not ruled out, though not considered likely --- no one has ever confirmed that the strong nuclear force can make such things.  I think also you&#039;d have a very hard time explaining how these strangelets formed without messing up precision measurements of the early cosmos, from the cosmic microwave background radiation.  But it requires calculation to check such things.

2) Gravity isn&#039;t a particle; gravitons are particles.  The same idea applies to electric forces: electric forces are generated by electric fields, which are not particles; but *waves* in those fields are made from particles, called photons [the particles out of which light is made, hence the name].

You can&#039;t make a star from massless objects, such as gravitons or photons.  They&#039;ll simply escape from one another.  

However, you most certainly can make black holes from gravitons and photons.  In fact you don&#039;t need gravitons to be particles in order to do it; you can make black holes, even in Einstein&#039;s non-quantum theory, out of gravitational (or electromagnetic) waves, without needing to use the fact that those waves are made from gravitons (or photons.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could dark matter be what is called strangelets or strange matter from possible quark stars?  And, perhaps another silly question. If gravity is a particle than perhaps black holes could be concentrated gravitons or a graviton star?]]></description>

Well, the &quot;asymptotic safety&quot; scenario isn&#039;t obviously consistent.  It&#039;s more of a hope and a hand-wave than a real theoretical construct.

Still, the Standard Model could be valid up to rather near the Planck scale.]]></description>
