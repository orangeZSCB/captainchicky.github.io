If you had understood the article, Krystal, you would see it explicitly says that there is lots and lots of doubt among scientists as to whether supersymmetry is the &quot;right theory&quot; (or more accurately, *a property of* the right theory of nature.)  That&#039;s why one of the things we&#039;re doing with the LHC is trying to look for signs of it... the way you resolve doubt in science is you do experiments.

The whole point of the article is that supersymmetry is useful even if it isn&#039;t true in nature.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t wish to put dampeners on this article, which is very informative and beautifully done, but  to say that it created a seed of a doubt in me if supersymmetry is the right theory. On macro scale, we humans are greatly affected by a need for organization and apply strict rules to achieve good results. I see the same mindedness applied to a world of quantum particles, which doesn&#039;t obey these rules. When I try to imagine what goes on inside a proton, I don&#039;t think of pairs of particles perfectly balancing their act to obey some unwritten law of physics, though this must be so. I think of it as a compressed form of energy that can not be subdivided into smaller components. What we call particles are just various properties of that state of energy that when put together a lot is happening.  there is a lot of attracting/repelling action going on in there.  A bit like EM energy with its polarity, hadronic energy is a mix of a few interacting aspects of energy that result in a workable mechanism with a staggering consistency. I think of this mechanism as being less perfect than the quantum theory suggests. I see energy 
not as one thing throughout the universe, dependent on matter, but a one flavor or combination of energy. the only combination that can create matter. Energy precedes matter, which is a confined state of energy submerged in a particular medium we call vacuum of space or quantum field.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/20/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-7/#comment-127162&quot;&gt;Eddie Devere&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Ed,

I hear you, and agree completely with your view that it is likely that there is an underlying structure to what we are seeing, but we just haven’t guessed at it yet. All the preon or subquark models that I am aware of have major problems to overcome. To me it seems like the elegant ones lack explanatory power – for example , Harari’s rishon model regards the muon and tau as merely excited states of the electron, and is helpless to explain why μ --&#062;e + γ does not occur. Other models introduce additional preons that carry ‘generation number’ but these seem completely ad-hoc. And they all suffer the fact that there is not the slightest bit of experimental evidence for any of them.

What I would like to see is the discovery of a particle that is not predicted by the Standard Model but is predicted by one of these many theories (including, as I noted, my own).]]></description>
