this post reminds me of my old room mate! He 
always kept chatting about this. I will forward this post

					<description><![CDATA[Heya! I just wanted to ask if you ever have any issues with hackers?
My last blog (wordpress) was hacked and I ended up losing a 
few months of hard work due to no backup. Do you 
have any solutions to stop hackers?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love your blog and find almost 
all of your post&#039;s to be just what I&#039;m looking for. Do you offer guest writers to 
write content for you personally? I wouldn&#039;t mind creating a post or elaborating on a few of the 
subjects you write in relation to here. Again, awesome web 
site!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can particles exist at different time frames (different time intervals between states? So  the graviton could be oscillating at a very low time interval since the big bang.

Hence we live at the speed of light while more fundamental particles live at much faster speeds.

Could a variable time be a way to factor in infinity to the math?]]></description>

No, it&#039;s not strange.  The probability of this happening is not small.  Coincidences happen every day.  That&#039;s why physicists calculate the statistical significance of things like this --- to determine whether this is a big coincidence or a small coincidence.  Given that ATLAS did not see anything similar, the probability that this is a coincidence is high.]]></description>
