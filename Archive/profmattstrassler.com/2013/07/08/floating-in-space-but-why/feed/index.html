					<description><![CDATA[Its like you read my mind! You appear to know so much about this, like you wrote the book in it 
or something. I think that you could do with some pics to drive the message home a little bit,
but instead of that, this is magnificent blog.
A fantastic read. I will certainly be back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice article as usual. I will try this on curious laymen!! Sometime I have used centrifugal force (a bad word) balancing gravitation in rotating frame. Apart from the fact that purists may hate it, it does not work in a free fall straight down. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another proof that gravity is still there: the Apollo spacecraft where going at escape velocity (~24,000 MPH) when leaving earth but over time slowed down to ~2,000 MPH by Earth’s gravity.  Then lunar gravity dominated and they accelerated again.  

I remember in grade school seeing an animation of a cannon on a mountain that was very much like Matt’s figure 5.  The animation was a great way to explain orbits to a ten year old…]]></description>
