					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/07/31/a-few-stories-worth-a-comment/#comment-73105&quot;&gt;Dilaton&lt;/a&gt;.

Three main purposes...

1) These particular speculative ideas get a lot of press, so it is helpful to my readers for me to give an explanation of what all the buzz is about.

2) One of these ideas (or something like them) might have shown up, and may still show up, in the LHC data.  Those who say that the LHC will see only the Standard Model are as unreasonably pessimistic as those who were confident supersymmetry would appear were unreasonably optimistic.

3) The ideas that I covered thoroughly have staying power; supersymmetry and extra dimensions will remain important in particle physics, as will string theory, into the next few decades at least, because of their  power as tools for understanding things that really are part of nature.

Note also that it was &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; that most &quot;BSM&quot; (Beyond-the-Standard-Model) ideas would be wrong.  There are hundreds of ideas and only one nature.  Indeed it is quite likely that all of those ideas are wrong.  Humans are not very smart, you know... it can easily take us a couple of decades, even collectively, to recognize something which in retrospect was obvious.

More generally, thinking outside the box of the universe we know is a way of both guessing what secrets nature might be hiding and appreciating nature as it is.  So BSM thinking is an important part of understanding the SM.  Of course it is also important for solving the unsolved problems of the SM and of gravity.  And it is in particular important for suggesting experiments to do, ones that might reveal presence of a speculative idea that someone has thought of, or for revealing something no one ever thought of.]]></description>

This should be a reply to the last comment above directed at me ...

I liked the previous article explaining how string theory was useful to do important calculations in the context of the Blackhat program a lot (not so much the corresponding comment discussion ...), and I would naturally look forward to a new article explaining how such  ideas don’t have to be right (in the sense of “true in nature”) to be profoundly important to understand different things.

But then, from reading the recent comments here concerning these issues, the conclusion seems to be that most of the current BSM physics concepts are most probably wrong anyway, and string theory (together with suppersymmetry which it needs) is at most a cool mathematical trick (similar to a transformation to a more conveniant coordinat system) to simplify  calculations occuring in the context of of various problems, such that only people who really work on such topics should be interested in these things. But others better forget about and should not be (too)  interested in such things ... ?

For example I quite liked the corresponding articles explaining BSM physics ideas here on this site, but  now I wonder what was the purpose of explaining such things to a non-expert audience ...]]></description>
