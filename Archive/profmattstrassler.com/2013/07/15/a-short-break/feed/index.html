The Higgs produces an attractive force between massive particles proportional to their masses. Because the Higgs is extremely massive, the force is short ranged like that of the weak bosons. Because stable particles (electrons, up and down quarks) have relatively weak interactions with the Higgs, the Higgs force is much, much weaker than the weak force. But, it&#039;s there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand that the Higgs field is significant in its effects on the other fields.

But I’ve been wondering if the Higgs particle plays any real role in interactions. I understand that the gauge bosons mediate force, and from what I understand their popping in and out of existence creates force. The fermions have the exclusion principle, but it seems the Higgs particle isn’t going to do much at all besides being a relic coming from needing a quanta for the Higgs field.

Is this analysis correct? It seems the Higgs particle is just really rare due to short lifetime and energy required to create it – although presumably it comes into existence temporarily frequently on universal scales, it seems not enough to really affect other particles.]]></description>
