					<description><![CDATA[Excellent talk!  Thanks for this!

I understand that a particle has energy stored in its vibration.  And that if the particle isn&#039;t moving (relative to me), we see that energy as mass.  And the Higgs field &quot;tightens&quot; the other fields, giving them a higher frequency, and thus more energy and mass.

My confusion is the &quot;not moving&quot; part.  I thought that in order for a particle to be stationary, it had to have mass.  A photon, for example, must travel at c relative to everything else because it&#039;s massless.  So, I feel like I&#039;ve built a circular argument in my head:  It appears to have mass when it&#039;s moving slowly relative to me, but in order to move slowly relative to me it has to have mass to begin with.  Do I misunderstand?

My second question is hopefully less abstract.  If the Higgs field didn&#039;t exist, the elementary particles would still have *some* vibrational frequency, correct?  And thus have some mass?  The Higgs field only tightens the other (affected) fields, it doesn&#039;t give them all of their energy, does it?]]></description>

Actually Matt, it is possible to turn the electron&#039;s mass-energy into the motion and mass-energy of other particles, because of conservation laws. You just drop it. Imagine the electron is in a brick. When you lift the brick you do work on it, you add energy, and we call it gravitational potential energy. Conservation of energy tells you that the mass of the brick has increased. When you drop it, the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which you can use to raise another brick containing another electron. 

Note that if you drop a 1kg brick into a black hole, the black hole mass increases by 1kg. Now imagine what happens when you drop an electron into a black hole from a great distance. It falls faster and faster and faster. Its rest mass is being converted into kinetic energy, and its &quot;relativistic mass&quot; remains constant. And yet the coordinate speed of light varies in a non-inertial reference frame. There comes a point when the infall speed crosses with the coordinate speed of light. Matter can&#039;t go faster than light, IMHO something bad has to happen, such as annihilation into orthogonal photons/neutrinos. I know that goes against the grain, but I just can&#039;t see any other option. You cannot convert the 511keV rest mass into relativistic mass and keep the rest mass at 511keV.]]></description>

It simply can&#039;t.  https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/

Conservation (physics-speak for &quot;preservation&quot;) of energy and momentum say that if the electron is to lose its mass-energy to the motion- (and mass-)energy of other particles, those particles must have smaller masses than the electron (indeed this is true for any decaying particle, that what it decays to must have less total mass than the original does; this is explained at the above link).  But conservation of electric charge says that since the electron has charge -e, what it decays to must have total charge -e.  Well, there are no objects in our universe that have any electric charge and have smaller mass than the electron.   The only things with smaller mass are neutrinos and photons and gravitons, and maybe other unknown things that have no charge.  Anything with lower mass than an electron and with an electric charge would have been easily discovered by now.  So therefore it is impossible for the electron to decay... i.e., it is impossible to turn the electron&#039;s mass-energy into the motion- and mass-energy of other particles, because to do so would violate known conservation laws.]]></description>

To a limited extent, yes; I won&#039;t argue.  But also, a &quot;perpetual motion machine&quot; is not something that merely violates energy conservation; it is an engine.  If energy non-conservation were all that we were talking about, we wouldn&#039;t need a machine; energy would spontaneously appear and disappear from nowhere in all basic particle physics processes.]]></description>

&quot;The statement that there can be no perpetual motion machine has nothing to do with this.&quot;

Well, the fact that energy is conserved is relevant for both.]]></description>
