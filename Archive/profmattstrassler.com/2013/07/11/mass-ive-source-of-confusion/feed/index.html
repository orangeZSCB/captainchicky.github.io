					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] NOTES: 1. In this article we speak of mass loss but in fact, we should write &#8220;rest mass&#8221; loss. The Einstein equivalence equation between matter and energy is true only for an object that is not moving. For an object that is moving, the total energy is greater than mass times the square of the speed of light. An object&#8217;s energy can change when its motion changes, but its mass never changes. This notion of mass is sometimes called &#8220;rest mass&#8221; because it is related to the energy stored in the object when it is not moving or &#8220;at rest&#8221;. There is another interpretation of mass called &#8220;relativistic mass&#8221; but it is not commonly used among nuclear/particle physicists.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/07/11/mass-ive-source-of-confusion/#comment-72820&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

I believe I have worked out how to get this in to my brain. 
I gave a previous example of accelerating to high speed turning you in to a black hole, which was an entirely incorrect assumption. However, I think it put me on to the right track. 

Apparently, while a fast moving object may appear to be a black hole from some reference frames it has to be like that from all reference frames to truly be considered a black hole. So thinking about it from the point of view of a hypothetical 2 particle true black hole just coming in to being, I figured that if you ever viewed the situation from one particle the other particle would contain all of the mass needed to still drag everything inevitably inward and vice versa.

So, applying that to the example here, if you have the 126 Higgs break down in to two quarks, then bring one quark to rest and measure its rest mass of 5, if you then measured the relativistic mass of the other quark then presumably its mass would be 121.

I understand this is probably an incredibly round about way of going about this, and I believe your second way of measuring the rest mass implied this all along, but is that right? Have I finally managed to grasp where the mass is going?]]></description>

Very interesting and accurate statement
Time dilation is a permanent feature of physical reality because velocity v is never exactly zero because measurement error is always non-zero--namely v is never equal to 0+_0---
Because of the very same reason rest mass is never a physical reality --namely mass can never be measured at exactly zero velocity

Very nice]]></description>

My humble view...
/internal energy or self energy and finally potential energy which depends on the potential at body location /.

Internal energy is time dependent, may be non axiomatic quantum action &quot;h&quot;, which may be outside the notion of mass. 
There is nothing called pottential energy at body location, because mass is relative.

It is all the problem of quantum mechanical definition of uncertainty principle. There is no continuous virtual particles or probability density. Virtual particles can only help micro electronics. 
The reality is &quot;relative mass&quot; which is the position and momentum of particles and macro objects - which cannot be calculated within our conscious world.
Through &quot;Equivalence principle&quot;, relative mass is adjusted as rest mass to fit our conscious world. At high energy (we may call at speed near c), the division of space inbetween quanta is reduced (reduce symmetry breaking), thus makes the matter disappear and slowdown the time (slowdown space expansion).]]></description>
