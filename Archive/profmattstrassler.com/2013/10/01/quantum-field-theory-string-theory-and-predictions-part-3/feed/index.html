					<description><![CDATA[Greetings from Los angeles! I&#039;m bored to death at work so I decided 
to browse your blog on my iphone during lunch break.
I enjoy the knowledge you provide here and can&#039;t wait 
to take a look when I get home. I&#039;m surprised at how quick your blog 
loaded on my mobile .. I&#039;m not even using WIFI, just 3G ..

Anyways, very good site!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;And in fact we expect QED to break down, due to quantum gravity ...&quot; Are there any physicists who DO NOT expect QED to break down due to quantum gravity? Consider this idea: In terms of measurement, QED breaks down due to quantum gravity if and only if Heisenberg&#039;s uncertainty principle needs to be replaced by an uncertainty principle involving both h-bar and alpha-prime. Is there any empirical proof that the preceding idea is wrong?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate the series of articles that you have started. I was just wondering about a few things discussed here. Refering to the statement: &#039;Then they go to the point on the horizontal axis where the quark masses equal their real-world values and the pion mass comes out agreeing with experiment, and they draw a vertical black line upward....&#039;
Now from what I know, we can&#039;t measure the exact masses of quarks due to their confinement properties (which restricts them from being observed as free particles). So from what I guess shouldn&#039;t it be more of a calculation to check the consistency? Something like this: &#039;Then they go to the point on the vertical axis where the hadron mass (say Omega&#039;s mass) equal their real-world values. The values of quark masses are noted at this point, and they draw a vertical black line upward at this point and check if the predicted value of other hadrons (say nucleons) is same as the real world values&#039;]]></description>
