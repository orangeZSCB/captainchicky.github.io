we destroyed the energy conservation inside an atom (shortest distance) and got the nuclear explosion.    What about distroying the energy conservation at &quot;zero point energy&quot; - distroying the rest mass - creating new space ?]]></description>

Veeramohan,
You are deeply confused about Physics in general. It is abundantly clear that you are arbitrarily mixing and matching various concepts without having a clear understanding of what they mean in the first place. Do yourself a favor and take a Physics 101 introductory course before cluttering this blog with nonsensical sentences.]]></description>

Sorry, as I understand (may be nonsense),  the Higgs particle is a &quot;ball&quot; on the spring. But by QM particle is the density of the excited spring thread - the localized ripple of the field - in which the space in between the spring threads (vacuum energy) also equally influence.        My understanding is, with the history of Relativity, can define only the particle nature (ball) - not the changing densities. The virtual particles make the difference negligible because, of the relative inertia (geodesic in GR) - almost the constancy ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/18/a-busy-week-at-cern/#comment-98654&quot;&gt;Nonsense&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Nonsense, 
I wrore this from a 2007 i Phone, while travelling on a bumpy road. I want to delete it, but there is no option. 

I tried to say (or ask) the difference between vacuum energy and mass energy.

Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter. All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation. 
Light is an electromagnetic wave. light creates an electromagnetic field by it self for transmit. 

Historically, the derivation of the strange properties of C (relativity) relies on a pretty straight forward piece of Einsteinian logic, based in part on an understanding of light.

1) All the laws of physics work the same, whether you’re moving or not. There is no experiment that can tell you whether or not you’re moving.-the “relative” inertia is constant (geodesic?). 

2) Light is an electromagnetic wave, and the velocity of these waves can be derived from Maxwell’s laws.

3) Maxwell’s laws, like all physical laws, are independent of how fast you’re moving. So the speed of light must also be independent of how fast you’re moving.

4) So, there exists a speed (the speed that light travels at) that is the same to everyone, no matter how fast they themselves are moving. Axiomatically, There’s your special relativity!

So why is C the fastest speed? 
A good way to think of it is to first ask; how do you know when you’re moving faster than something else? If you’re driving down the highway and you’re moving faster than the car in front of you, then eventually you’ll pass that car. However, C is the same to everyone, no matter what. So, say a photon goes past you, and you try to catch up. But no matter how much you speed up, the photon will always be moving away at the speed of light. You can never catch up (or even come close to starting to catch up). So, regardless of perspective, the photon is always moving faster than you.
Some of this may seem seem contradictory, but surprisingly, it’s all self consistent (Localised). Very surprisingly. ???]]></description>

The speed of light &quot;c&quot; have....the speed of light &quot;c&quot; has !

How can the speed of light have maximum speed? 

&quot;Because there is almost no mass energy&quot;...no physical content in your statement!

Heat is NOT electromagnetic radiation!

&quot;It produce heat (electromagnetic radiation) because there is some mass energy, with reference to it’s own speed – and that is measurable. At the total abscence of localized mass energy, the vacuum energy will travel very fast at very short distance due to it’s energy content ?&quot;...again, nothing but sheer nonsense! 

Please stop polluting this site with your incoherent babbling!]]></description>

&quot;Einstein was more German than jewish&quot;.

Your sense of humor is irresistible. 

Could you please go read first some elementary texts in physics and history of physics before drowning this blog entry with crackpot comments?]]></description>
