I agree. Remember, these are identical colliding proton beams. There might be  slight difference because they do not collide at exactly 180 degrees, but at slightly different angle. I could be wrong of course!!]]></description>

I think &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; here are equivalent directions, except that the detector is only on the &quot;forward&quot; side.  Reading carefully, I think they could have switched directions and still had the same setup.]]></description>
