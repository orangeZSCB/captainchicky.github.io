					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to see Aephraim Steinberg et al and Jeff Lundeen et al get some kind of prize for weak measurement. I think it&#039;s premature to award any prizes for the Higgs myself. It&#039;s had a huge amount of publicity, but when you look closely at what CERN physicists have said, the picture isn&#039;t quite so clear.]]></description>
