					<description><![CDATA[Allow me to get this comment straight: when you say &quot;This is always true for gluons&quot;, it is my understanding that it is because gluons are the mediators of the strong nuclear force, which happens to be a strong interaction, is that right?]]></description>

Let me be even more precise; the only quantity which is actually physically meaningful is the number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks.  Quark number, antiquark number, and gluon number are not physical operators in the Hilbert space of the quantum mechanical theory; you simply cannot define them. This is always true for gluons, and true also for quarks and antiquarks once the forces involved aren&#039;t weak.  [It&#039;s even true for electrons and positrons and photons if you imagine making electromagnetism into a strong force.]  Even if you try, you will never find a physical system in which the number is specified.]]></description>

We only know that the &quot;neutral color&quot; constraints apply, but there are still some degrees of freedom available for the actual number to be undetermined!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for the heads up!

So, it is the energy contents that is related to the mass of hadrons and we can&#039;t actually predict the number of quarks, antiquarks and gluons inside a hadron, but it is my understanding that, no matter what the number is, the actual number of particles must follow the &quot;neutral color&quot; rules, right?]]></description>

The numbers of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons in a proton are not quantum mechanically specified in a proton --- in somewhat the same way that the position of an electron in an atom cannot be specified in the ground state of a hydrogen atom.  

And indeed, the mass of a proton is related to the *energy* of the objects inside it -- divided by c^2 -- which is not determined by the number of objects inside it, or their masses.  

The proton is complicated, and it isn&#039;t just a bag of massive objects sitting in place.  Everything inside it is whizzing around, colliding, appearing and disappearing... highly relativistic, and completely counter to your standard, non-relativistic, atomic intuition.]]></description>

I&#039;m a little confused.  Figure 6 contains data (the dots) and a model (the curve).  If you are talking about how the curve was obtained, then the answer is &quot;sort of, but the model is of a rather different sort...&quot; The precise details of the quarks and antiquarks inside the proton aren&#039;t believed to be relevant, because it is believed that the physics that dominates the total cross-section has to do entirely with the many gluons in the proton.  (There is strong evidence from several sources.)   In fact proton-antiproton cross-sections are almost identical, and it is expected (though we can&#039;t actually do the experiment) that proton-neutron and neutron-neutron and neutron-antineutron etc. scattering cross-sections would also be essentially identical.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a question regarding the &quot;swarm&quot; of quarks that compose the hadrons (proton and neutron) ... It is my understanding that all those quarks moving within the proton or the neutron play a part in the determination of the mass of the proton and the neutron. My doubt is: the proton and the neutron have a very precise mass, so, how is it that that we can&#039;t determine with some precision how many quarks are inside them?

Or is it that the mass of the proton or the neutron is undirectly related to the number of quarks inside them?]]></description>
