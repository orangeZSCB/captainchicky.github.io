@MattStrassler It would be very interesting if you can summarize the theoretical speculations around dark forces in the eXciting Dark matter theories.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your interest.  The other cases were similar, so are Al27, P31, Se45, V50, Mn55. etc.  All single odd stabile isotopes. So the point is something very different and interesting is happening.  And the second point is with all the high powered math, someone ought to have an answer if the math is any good !!!]]></description>

Until an experiment is performed to determine the gravitational acceleration of anti-hydrogen there remains the possibility that anti-hydrogen will fall up at 1g. This, despite General Relativity, despite the interpretation of the data you have so nicely presented, as well as various theoretical arguments made against antigravity since the mid-1950’s.  Between 2014 and 2020 there will actually be a few experiments conducted to test this possibility. Until then please allow me my foolish belief in this possibility and understand why I mentally cringe at the idea of anti-quarks within the proton…]]></description>

Honestly I do not know the exact answer! Perhaps a nuclear physicist on this blog would answer. But here is my 2 cents worth!! Alpha particles are extraordinarily stable. So Be(8) -&#062;2 alphas has a strong probability. In fact that was a big problem for cosmology ,how did periodic table advance after Be(8) to form carbon etc. Fred Hoyle explained that there was a resonant capture of other alpha particle to form C(12) because of closeness of some nuclear energy level. This gave rise to anthropic argument. The extra neutron adds stability to Be(9) by additional attractive  force. I do not know about the other two nuclei you mentioned. It probably depends on the shell structure. I do not have it handy. In any case I would also be interested in the answer from cosmology point of view. Let us see what Matt says about this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Multiverses are unknowable in themselves by their very nature , so unknowables exist ,so what are you arguing about after you admitted it in your reference to UCP........is it just the urge to be seen as superior ? calm down we are not in a contest for the better.
Back to the start : we can never be sure that the future will give all answers , it may well be the case that answers are veiled , unknowable, why this is hurting you so much? Maybe since it demolish Naturalism foundations? Maybe it shakes the bases of atheism ? ......rest in peace .]]></description>
