					<description><![CDATA[Visit to purchase Computer Cuisine Deluxe for $29.

That translates into energy savings and that is a huge gain in today&#039;s slow economy.
Traditional flashlights often become nothing more than tombs for dead batteries offering little or no use in our time of 
need.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A fabulous feature for the kitchen is a wall oven,

					<description><![CDATA[IMHO, there is not much to either argue or have major doubts about the objective fact that the shutdown is decimating both small and large science projects all over the country, and that the consequences to science in America will be more devastating and lasting that the shutdown itself.

Whether or not we agree on the truth and goodness of the Obamacare Law ... but that&#039;s another story, like Rudyard Kipling wrote.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Once again I will point out, none of you Obama supporting, conservative hating academics living off other people&#039;s money cared a whit when Obama, Pelosi and Reid put doctors, hospital workers, insurance agents, coal miners, LVNs, car dealers etc.. out of work.  Obama destroyed my future and my medical practice 4 years ago and most of you cheered him on.  I hope you all lose your jobs forever and never get another dime of other people&#039;s money.  Go get some real jobs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/11/more-scientist-hostages-uncovered/#comment-92372&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

I am still waiting for someone to answer Someguy’s question:  “What short of crisis will motivate politicians to make the changes we both agree are needed?”

They (both republicans and democrats) will kick the can down the road yet again, they will print even more money that they don’t have…they will continue to call the myriad of wasteful government programs “rounding errors” – so that they don’t have to look at them. One side will continue to refuse new taxes, the other will continue to refuse to make real cuts in spending  - counting reductions in projected increases as “budget cuts” and saying that they have already significantly cut the deficit (which will technically be true – the mindless sequester forced them to spend less money that they don’t have this year relative to last year – so they “cut the deficit”). Both sides apparently “deadlocked”, but in reality both sides playing the American Public for fools, knowing that the required painful actions will not happen on their watch thus virtually guaranteeing their re-election… 

So Someguy you won’t get an answer. Because, unfortunately, the real answer is: “Nothing” – short of the real crisis that you know is coming and of course then it will be too late. Take solace in the fact that like Winston Churchill, you warned them…]]></description>

mmm, I would say that virtual particles are due to the uncertainty principle, while particle physicists study their behaviour so as to have better explanations of said behaviours.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>
