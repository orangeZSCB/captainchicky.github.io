					<description><![CDATA[More borrowing for my children to pay off! Fantastic news.

Sequester and shut downs are obviously not a good way to do things, and we don&#039;t want to go anywhere near default... but ultimately borrowing needs to stop somewhere, forcing other (future) people to pay for things you want is immoral. This mess is what happens when politicians can&#039;t do their job, both in congress and in the WH.]]></description>

The Republican failed to defund the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was enacted by the 111th USA congress, in spite of government shut-down and threat of default they brandished. There are implications some of which could be rectified e.g. billions of dollar lost as well as credibility of the US government. I think having a resolute president,  is advantageous for regaining credibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should all read my comment above - you&#039;re all hypocrites.  Obama and the Democrats have destroyed hundreds of jobs in industries they don&#039;t approve of, and Obamacare has destroyed my previously successful medical practice which is now bankrupt.  None of you cared about my rights when Obama, Pelosi and Reid used every dirty trick in the book to destroy me.  A pox on all of you.  Whiners and hypocrites.]]></description>

Obamacare is a disaster.  All the media and Democrats do is lie.  Hospitals and doctors are already going out of business.  I know. I was a successful physician, and then Obama got elected.  So you can whine all you want Matt, but I&#039;m done.  You&#039;re a great teacher, but you can&#039;t see past your own biases. You and all your academic whiner friends here on this post whining about your mortgages and rights and the future etc.., etc...didn&#039;t give a damn when the Democrat party destroyed my future and livelihood.  I can always get food stamps I guess.  You academics are the most spoiled and childish tantruming class ever.  I hope you all crash and burn.]]></description>
