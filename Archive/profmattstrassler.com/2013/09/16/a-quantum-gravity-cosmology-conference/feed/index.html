					<description><![CDATA[Hi, My name&#039;s Graham and an interested layman in all of this.
As I understand it, general relativity says that massive bodies causes a warping of spacetime and that that is what we experience as gravity. So why is the graviton (ie a particle) needed?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/16/a-quantum-gravity-cosmology-conference/#comment-151747&quot;&gt;Alain&lt;/a&gt;.

So Alain, based upon your name and the information you provided, I have narrowed you down to 3 candidates:

Alain Blondel - University of Geneva
Department of Particle Physics

Dr. Alain Bellerive
Professor, Particle Physics
Carleton ATLAS Group

Dr. Alain Aspect
French Physicist

Of these candidates, I imagine that you are Dr. Alain Bellerive. My deductive reasoning was that you are fairly young and have a greater Internet presence. Also, Bellerive has a Ph.D. in the domain of Particle Physics. If correct, you would have been involved in the ATLAS Experiment that announced the discovery of the Higgs Boson in July 2012, where Peter Higgs and François Englert went on to win the prestigious Nobel Prize for their work in predicting the particle back in 1964. I bet y&#039;all broke open some champaign bottles that day and congradulated each other&#039;s &#039;success.&#039; I had commented on the possibility of physicists finding something that they would mistake as the Higgs Boson a few months before the news. My mathematical equations definitively prove that the Higgs Mechanism is an incorrect theory. What does Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking explain? It is just smoke and mirrors for the fact that they could not explain the true underlying mechanics. Unlike the 13.25 billion dollars that it cost to find the &#039;Higgs Boson,&#039; it did not cost taxpayers a penny for my research. I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter!]]></description>
