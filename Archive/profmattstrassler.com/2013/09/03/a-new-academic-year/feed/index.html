					<description><![CDATA[Dear Professor: I recently saw a video of a talk by Dr Fay Dowker given at the Perimeter Institute in which she claimed the cosmological constant problem had been solved long before dark energy was discovered by theorists working on the Causal Set structure of spacetime. What do you think about that? Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read a few statements by leading physicists like Lee Smolin who seem to think that a lot pf this is farflung.  I however,  think you may be going in the right direction and only time will tell.   Until then,  I will continue to follow the field and read more on  it.
