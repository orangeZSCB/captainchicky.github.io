					<description><![CDATA[I believe what you said was actually very logical. However, 
think on this, suppose you composed a catchier title?
I ain&#039;t saying your information isn&#039;t solid, however suppose you added something that makes people 
desire more? I mean Did the LHC Just Rule Out String Theory?!
&#124; Of Particular Significance is a little boring.
You should glance at Yahoo&#039;s front page and see how they create article titles to get people 
interested. You might add a video or a picture or two to get people excited about everything&#039;ve written. Just my opinion, it would bring your 
posts a little bit more interesting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Du - Juan Harris - RB Green Bay Packers Although he 
hinted that he would go back to selling cars in the offseason, 
I have a feeling that Du - Juan Harris will not be on any car lot at the beginning of the 2013 NFL 
season. It is Tennessee&#039;s Rocky Top, Florida&#039;s Old Ball Coach, and of course the Gator Chomp and the mighty Tim 
Tebow. Among those that came out in the wish list is a better line play, addition of team entrances, and crowd atmosphere.]]></description>
