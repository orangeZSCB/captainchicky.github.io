Can you suggest any other blogs/websites/forums that cover the same

“Born on Mars … Raised on Earth.”

It could have happened that way. But as I note in my lengthy comment below, there are some problems with that. On the contrary, if recent datings becomes as successful as they promise, the situation could be the reverse.

Maybe Musk grandchildren will have reason to put on their CV: “Born on Earth … Raised on Mars.” [I know, I know, not as surprising.]]]></description>

Oops. I posted an earlier revision:

&quot;200 Ma is enough for life to arise, but note that it is after the first (arguable) trace fossils on Earth. (Isua BIFs that predicts Fe reducers &#062; 3.8 Ga bp.) And it is after the main late bombardment transferred material in either direction. Maybe martian life, if any, was or is tellurian in origin.&quot;]]></description>

@martenvandijk: Those of us who hasn&#039;t the luxury to reject hard won science facts notes that the observation that global warming is caused by human actions is now at 3 sigma, physics quality of theory testing.

You can have your opinion but you can&#039;t own facts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested in astrobiology, so I&#039;ll note that Kirschvink&#039;s (and before him Bennett&#039;s) notions are outdated. 

We do have trace fossils in early zircons that shows that early Earth both had extensive oceans and extensive dry land weathering. So even if we stick with the now less popular pure RNA world scenario instead of a &quot;dirty&quot; RNA wold (coevolving metabolism, proteins, RNA), Earth could sustain the pathway. 

And while the martian timeline is still confused and arguable, there is a successful theory that it was habitable ~ 3.8 - 3.6 Ga ago, when Tharsis let off enough volatiles for surface water. 200 Ma is enough for life to arise, but note that it is after the first (arguable) trace fossils on Earth. (Isua BIFs that predicts Fe reducers &#062; 3.8 Ga bp) And after the main late bombardment transfered material.

&quot;it’s somewhat bizarre that Dyson never won a Nobel Prize. Arguably it is part of the nature of the awarding process, which typically rewards a specific, deep line of research, and not a polymath whose contributions are spread widely.&quot;

Well, the article&#039;s discussion of prizes is somewhat bizzare. Yes, the Nobel Prize awards individuals that has contributed to science progress, not the person. Nothing bizarre here.

Added to that the Nobel Prize is centered on discoveries, since Nobel was an inventor and thought mostly inventions but also discoveries were useful. Dyson may never have contributed with such. (E.g. if someone discovers a Dyson swarm, he can get rewarded.)

Also, the Templeton prize is not in science and has an anti-science purpose, to mix beliefs of religion into facts of science. An analog is if we wanted to award astrology, once a religious tool, to a scientist. That Dyson got it is not meritorious (and he could have abstained).]]></description>

It would be interesting if he made the argument explicit in a way that an expert agreed with. If it&#039;s a mathematical argument then comm math phy would be a good target. The problem is he just posts his vague idea on blogs - what a dimwit. Write it down exactly you fuckwit.]]></description>
