					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm.  Intuitively, finely-tuned interaction strengths are what you would expect to see in the vacuum state of a QFT where the couplings between the fields are themselves quantum fields, or perhaps some other sort of quantum observable.  Put another way, if the couplings are free to change in a way that minimizes the zero-point energy, you&#039;d expect them to wind up finely-tuned.

On the other hand, if I understand what you&#039;ve said about the difference between the cosmological constant problem and the naturalness problem correctly, it isn&#039;t immediately obvious that minimizing the zero-point energy would explain the naturalness problem, but it could be worth a try.  I&#039;m guessing this is an approach that has already been looked into, or is there an obvious problem that rules it out?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/09/unnaturalness-explained/#comment-84594&quot;&gt;aa.sh.&lt;/a&gt;.

It is very rude to go up to hardworking scientists and call what they are doing fantasies. Especially when they deliver hard results like the Higgs field.

Ironically that you yourself indulge in fantasies that require a) lying about the science (e.g. &quot;infinite steady state universe&quot;, &quot;case closed&quot;) to open up a gap and then b) inserting magic action in the gap doesn&#039;t seem to bother you.

The case that has been closed of is precisely magic action, since our current universe was a result of previous inflation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[NATURALNESS MEANS CATASTROPHE !

From Science to God, challenges science&#039;s assumption that the material world is the primary reality. Rather than trying to account for consciousness in terms of the material world, it proposes that consciousness is as fundamental as space, time, and matter -perhaps even more so.
The roots of this alternative worldview go back two hundred years to Immanuel Kant, who drew a clear distinction between the things in-itself and our experience of it. We think we see the world out there, but all we ever observe is the image created in the mind. 
In Physics, space and time have been demoted from their absolute status. They are, showed Einstein, relative to an observer&#039;s point of view. In their place we find the absoluteness of light. For a photon traveling at the speed of light, as all photons do, time and space disappear. In some strange way, light seems to lie beyond both space and time - and, since it has no mass, beyond matter too.

Mathematical logic is an addiction like hallucination - creating a perfect axiomatic world - create an aversion towards semantic reality (unNaturalness). It is having its own autonomous aim (entropy) called naturalness ! 

If the “semantics” of automation languages conceptually, built on mathematical logic” (UnNaturalness) – then, no way to avoid entropy increase to the degree of total randomness. UNLESS , again a very big one intervene, there will be catastrophe (naturalness) ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[aa.sh you somehow jump to the conclusion that there is only one other answer .... I can think of at least two other choices on the same data.
