					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] A couple weeks back, there was a bit of a scuffle between Matt Strassler and Peter Woit on the subject of predictions in string theory (or more properly, the question of whether any predictions can be made at all). As a result, Strassler has begun a series on the subject of quantum field theory, string theory, and predictions. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All that being said, I wish you hadn&#039;t made the occasional snarky remark about Woit&#039;s publication record etc in your debate last week.

Its one of Woit&#039;s favourite tactics in debate:

- He will keep making remarks about how his opponent is muddying the waters, misunderstanding basic issues, setting up straw men etc etc until the opponent is provoked into making a personal attack.

- Then he will immediately play the victim, claim that the entire argument is politically/personally motivated and hence he has no further interest.

Anyway, I at least learned a lot from the arguments you were making.
Thanks for that !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Prof Strassler, I&#039;m coming very late to the party, but for whatever its worth:

Q1: Regarding you being misleading - Not at all. The distinction was very apparent. In fact, your comparison of string theory vacua to initial conditions in Newtonian gravity was a revelation and put a lot of things into perspective for me.

Q2: Regarding Woit - I&#039;ve followed his blog for quite a while. 
He is focused mainly on criticizing string theory unification - in particular, the fact that ST currently makes no useful predictions about particle physics.
He also spends a lot of time critiquing the &quot;Multiverse and Landscape&quot; combo, and IMO, rightly so.
The claim that &quot;String theory predicts a Multiverse with many different laws of physics&quot; is incorrect and simply dishonest.
I&#039;m not sure whether string theorists or the media are responsible for this hype - to me it looks like Woit blames string theorists.

Q3: However, I HAVE seen Woit make stronger claims that string theory is not even consistent, and that applications in other areas are not  useful either. See for instance, here:
http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6252

Reading his blog, I got the distinct impression that String Theory is a set of vaguely defined calculations and approximations without any clear underlying principles or even a self consistent framework.

If, as you say, (in your most recent posts), you DO have a consistent framework and equations, and the main obstacle to Application 1 is a near-infinite choice of initial conditions, then this certainly is very misleading.

Looking forward to your sequence on QFT and string theory.]]></description>
