					<description><![CDATA[Unquestionably consider that that you stated. Your favourite justification seemed to be at the web the easiest 
thing to bear in mind of. I say to you, I definitely 
get irked even as folks consider worries that they just do noot recognise about.
You controlled to hit thee nail upon the top and also outlined outt the entire thing with noo need side effect , other 
folks could take a signal. Willl likely be back to get more.
Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[* I made this up.  (Except for the stack of disks part.  I added that just to tie it in to a concept I had already thought about.)

   

* This is how I think about multidirectional space, string theory particle entanglement etc.  Multi-dimensional space.  (in excess of 3.)  Look at the &quot;shadow&quot; of a 3 dimensional object and it will be a 2 dimensional representation of a 3d object .. 4 dimensional objects &quot;shadow&quot; would be a 3 dimensional representation of a 4d object. Think of existence being a bubble with everything existing on the membrane of soap.  The first dimension as well as the extra dimensions could be perceived as membranes. You have &quot;light&quot; projecting from outside the bubble to inside.  The projection inside the bubble is our perceived universe.  This would also allow you to have multiple simultaneous universes occupying the same space by having different types of &quot;light&quot; projecting at different angles/frequency&#039;s etc. (Perhaps it takes 3 lights to create our 3 dimensional space.  Our arrangement of particles consists of those projections.  This could explain why we can only perceive 3 directly. 



These projections from this membrane would represent different &quot;Particles&quot; that would have an intimate relationships with one another which would not be immediately apparent.  (particle entanglement etc.)



This would also explain string theory .. or at least my limited understanding of it.  Why particles look like strings or loops from different perspectives. (vibrations of the membrane or membranes interacting with one another.)  This “light” would also be the limit of how fast anything could move.  If you were to travel the speed of light, which would essentially mean you have reached the membrane (the threshold between dimensions) you would have infinite mass/energy and occupy all space and time.  From our perspective anyway. (And or you would “pop” out of our existence.  Which might translate to the projection of your particles back into the bubble so you are not being destroyed but changing states.)  (You would be projected into 3 dimensions and operate on a higher one)  This projection could also be viewed during any point depending on which portion of the projected light you were looking at.  (Referencing the wiki article where they describe it as a stack of disks representing the state of the universe at a given time.)  Like the light we see from stars millions of years old.  This concept would also explain the time differences when moving at speed.  You change your location on that projection.  Imagine you are on a highway .. with everyone else going a portion of light speed.  You accelerate which goes into their future while the time passes to you at the same speed.  You are in their future and your present.  Every car on the road exists through their entire time line simultaneously. (As long as the car exists in time. This “car” is a collection of particles and or energy in a certain relationship.  These particles/energy can’t be destroyed but their relationship can change into something not car like.) We just cannot perceive it.  Otherwise if you were to take a flight and accelerate into the future nothing would be there.  You could translate this up through more and more dimensions with each iteration being able to interact (and be in a relationship) with the others but not perceivable by us other than through inference.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] To fix this problem, physicists first tried to make a new version of particle theory that was consistent with relativity, but it didn&#8217;t entirely work.  However, it served as an essential building block in their gradual invention of what is called quantum field theory, described in much more detail in previous posts, starting here. (Again: the distinction between &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; and &#8220;a quantum field theory&#8221; is that of the general versus the specific case; see this post for a more detailed discussion of the terminology.)
