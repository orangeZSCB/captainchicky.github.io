					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt,
I see why this is a real problem, thanks for the illuminating article as always.
Can I ask a more basic question about the cosmological constant and its consequences? I apologize if this is a hoary old one but I never really found a definitive answer (although you have touched on it in other articles). Here Goes:

I have no problem with the concept of the expansion of &quot;space&quot; due to some cosmological constant. Can we visualise this as tiny additions to all the quantum fields periodically appearing at random locations?
While I get that this is not a force between objects, it is nevertheless said to result in objects at large scales moving further apart. If these objects at large scales are being carried along with &quot;space&quot; as it expands, then the objects (or the matter from which they are made) must be interacting with said &quot;space&quot;; the objects are moved relative to one another, &quot;space&quot; does not simply slide through everything.
So the next logical question people like me ask is something like: &#039;what happens to the &quot;space&quot; inside a proton?, and does this affect the proton in any way?&#039;. In other words if large scale objects, like galaxies,  move apart as a result of &quot;space&quot; expanding, do those same objects also grow larger? If they do, then is there then a cut-off scale at which this effect no longer applies? I am sure most people are not comfortable with the notion that a proton today could be a different size that it was in the past due to &quot;space&quot; expanding.

BTW - how do you track these comments in all these articles? is there a time limit for each &#039;thread&#039;? it looks as though whenever you add a new article the volume of incoming questions would increase...I hope you are not swamped..
Cheers

There is a simpler explanation for the acceleration and I prefer Occam&#039;s razor. There is uncertainties with that modeling and we both have our own views regarding Pioneer anomalies, that&#039;s ok. We need a better example for the &quot;new&quot; physics.

But things are going to be *much* more interesting in the case of Juno Earth flyby! There the effect is a very strong compared to Pioneer. What is your suggestion as the cause for the flyby anomaly? It surely ain&#039;t thermal recoil force, right? ;)]]></description>

&quot;Mr. Anderson&quot;?  The result regarding the effect of the thermal recoil force was reached by several research groups independently.  What reason do you have to suspect that they have each independently made an error in their analysis?]]></description>
