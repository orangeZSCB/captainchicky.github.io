					<description><![CDATA[My mistake ... if we apply the i versor to a scalar, the result is a 90 degree rotation applied in the scalar number... If we multiply the i versor with itself, it will be a second 90 degree rotation that is added to the original 90 degree rotation that the i versor itself &quot;contains&quot;, thus, i^2 == -1.

In the case of Minkowski&#039;s space, the i versor applies a 90 degree rotation to the 3 dimensional space of the 3 real dimensions, which means that time is in a fourth dimension that is normal (perpendicular to) the other 3 real dimensions that we know of.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[BTW, Minkowski&#039;s space-time is a four dimensional manifold  in a complex space, so, when we mix complex variables with integer powers, many &quot;funny&quot; things happen with the sign.

Complex variables always have at least one imaginary coordinate, that is clearly identified by the i versor (a vector of unitary magnitude or size).

The i versor has some interesting &quot;geometric&quot; properties.

When we multiply the i versor with itself, it behaves in such a way that we can say that it rotates 90 degrees in the positive direction of angles (depending on the convention selected for positive angles).

This rotation takes place within the same plane that contains  the i versor.

So, if we have an i versor and multiply it once with an i versor, it will rotate 90 degrees. If we apply the same transformation again, it will rotata again another 90 degrees, so, at the end of the second transformation, the original i versor will have accumulated a 180 degree rotation, which means that now is pointing in the opposite direction in comparison to the original direction.

This is the same as saying that it has changed its sign, thus, i^2 == -1.

On short, when it comes to particle physics, we just can&#039;t do word games with Energy and Mass  and Waves and Particles: we have to follow the rules of Physics.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice argument, but that is not the way to determine the outcomes of particle-antiparticle pairs. 

When I say outcomes that is not typo, as on most cases, any given pair of particle-antiparticle may end up having many possible outcomes. 

These computations are really complex and difficult to follow through to get the right answers. 

This is the result of the stochastic (probabilistic) behaviour of quantum particles.

The computations required to determine the outcomes are based on Path Integral formulas originally devised by Richard P. Feyman, and the way to simplify and account for all possible paths (all possible outcomes down the line) is with the use of Feynman diagrams.

Path Integral calculations and Feyman Diagrams take into consideration all relevant aspects of the behaviour of quantum particles, including all conservation laws at play.

Regarding negative energies,  positive masses and the &quot;equivalence&quot; of mass and energy, there are a few things (and subtleties) that have to be considered that a bird&#039;s eye view approach may miss.

To start with, the equivalence of mass and energy is the result of a pythagorean relationship between Energy, Momentum and Mass, and not just a linear and direct relationship between just Energy and Mass.

This pythagorean equation considers an instantaneous equivalence, that is , an equivalence that exists a given &quot;point&quot; in space-time (any such point has 4 values as coordinates), and even though that equivalence stays true at all times, the actual numeric values change with the coordinates in space-time.

When we compare a start pair of particle-antiparticle with the next end pair of pair-antiparticle within the same decay path, we have to consider all these elements (Energy, Momentum and Mass, pythagorean relationship between them that involves the square or second power of each term, etc.).

If we do the math with these equations, it is very simple to see how energies can have different signs and masses remain positive, for the cases of particles-antiparticles that present this particular behaviour .

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>
