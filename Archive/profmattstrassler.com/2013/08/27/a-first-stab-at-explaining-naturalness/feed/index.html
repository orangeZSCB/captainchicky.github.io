					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for enlightening us, Matt on the problems of &#039;unnaturalness&#039; of the universe. I&#039;m sure you know where the problem lays. I only hope that you will share it with us, such an ungrateful audience. I have a &#039;need&#039; to understand what this universe is like and the nuts and bolts of everything, and could not be possibly happy with closing the doors to these unanswered questions that are pestering my mind.  Since we can&#039;t do the field tests to find out what really is out there, we rely on examining the micro world and pasting things together into a wider picture of the universe. So far this approach has paid us good dividends, but all is not sticking nicely together. Just as when a broken vase that has been hastily glued together, can never look right any more, especially if we missed couple of smaller pieces of glass or ceramics. The finished product will be aesthetically unpleasing. likewise, something is not adding up to our expectations of the nature of the universe that it has to be 100% balanced. If universe is functioning on the edge of a knife it is disconcerting because 
not only is our future at stake, but also our sanity. So, I fully trust that you Matt have needed qualifications and abilities to solve this problem. I know you can do it.]]></description>

It would be very unnatural for a process to produce only one object. So we can&#039;t be sure what &quot;what it is&quot; is. 

This is before you veer into philosophy of course, where you can imagine anything, even that you have only one universe out of inflation. (To name the first process which naturally creates many universes.)]]></description>

Actually Ididn&#039;t reblog it but used portions of this and related posts to discuss the issue on my blog. Within the post, I write a make-believe letter to the poor, scorned Higgs particle!

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Matt for explaining some of these concepts.  It is really disheartening reading internet discussions about some of these particle physics topics where it is construed as if the whole field is filled with simpletons..  

Perhaps going over some of the old objections to naturalness that are manifestly wrong.. Like the usual nonsequiturs, eg dimensional regularzation and the concepts where people simply claim that any old naive UV theory can fix everything no problem.]]></description>
