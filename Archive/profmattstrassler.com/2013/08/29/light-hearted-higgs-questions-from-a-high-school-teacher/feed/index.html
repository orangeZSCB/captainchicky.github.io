					<description><![CDATA[A follow up question from a lay person if  I may:
How do we know, or why do we believe, that the Higgs field is uniform at very large scale? 
Is it possible that electrons gigaparsecs away may have a slightly different mass than those near earth?

BYW: I want to thank you for your excellent explanations of particle decay and electron spin. :)]]></description>

People!

Matt refers above to a talk he gave, link here:
http://grassrootstv.org/Show.aspx?ShowID=11527

It&#039;s an absolute GEM.  I watched it twice.  Don&#039;t miss it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While the mechanism for turning off the Higgs field is unknown/doesn&#039;t exist you mentioned scales of energies needed to disable it for fairly large regions like a class room or the earth. If it was restricted to a region that was much smaller, i.e. a cubic planck length or the &#039;volume&#039; of a quark or other particle. Would these energy amounts even be within the realm of possibility?]]></description>

Of course; I always make this point very clearly in public talks and articles, see for example https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/20/why-the-higgs-matters-in-a-few-sentences/ , https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/ , https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/ , http://grassrootstv.org/Show.aspx?ShowID=11527 

However, if you calculate carefully -- and this is a point I don&#039;t make often, and I haven&#039;t yet got enough stuff on this website to explain it properly to the public -- actually the QCD condensate scale goes down by about a factor of close to 2 if you set the Higgs field&#039;s value to zero.  It&#039;s purely an accident that it&#039;s a factor of 2 rather than a factor of 10 or 1.3 -- it&#039;s a consequence of the way the strength of the strong nuclear force is changed when the top and bottom and charm quarks lose their large masses.]]></description>

Actually, Matt, most of your energy comes from the QCD condensate....it&#039;s mostly nucleons.]]></description>

Matt--a brief answer is &quot;no&quot;.   One needs to know the shape of the potential (in this case 2-field) between the minima, and you don&#039;t give that.   Given the shape, one can solve the bounce equations and calculate the critical bubble radius.   It&#039;s messy, but doable, but certainly not simple.  In many inflationary models (and the SM), the potential, to a good approximation is - lambda phi^4 for which there is an analytic solution.  But with two fields, it is a lot messier.]]></description>
