Geologists have already used neutrinos, not for image probing, but to probe the radiogenic heat flux out of Earth:

&quot; But it was not until 2005 that the KamLAND collaboration reported the first detection of geoneutrinos.1 Now, with five times as much data in hand, the international collaboration has reported its first substantive geophysics result.

The principal finding is that present-day radioactivity accounts for about half of the total heat flux from Earth’s interior. That’s no great surprise to geologists. But it does supply the first explicit measurement of the radiogenic heat flux—albeit still with large error bars—for comparison with the broad range of detailed models of Earth’s formation and the energy sources of plate tectonics and the geodynamo.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, I followed your link to matter and energy and wasn&#039;t keen. Take a fresh-eyed look at Compton scattering where some of the photon E=hf energy is converted into the motion of an electron. The thing is, you could do another Compton scatter on the residual photon, and another and another ad infinitum. In the limit there&#039;s no photon left. Take all the energy out of a wave, and it just isn&#039;t there any more. It has been converted entirely into the motion of electrons. It has been converted entirely into motion. And yet in pair production, you can make an electron (and a positron) out of a photon. So in a way, matter is made of motion. Or kinetic energy if you prefer. Or just energy. Hence E=mc². It isn&#039;t something it has, it&#039;s what it is. I really wish I could engage guys like you with stuff like this. I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve read Unzicker&#039;s book, but it is scarey, and makes me feel that time is running out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a mystery about neutrinos that I discussed on a different blog but I&#039;m still having trouble wrapping my head around. 

Neutrinos all seem to have a -1/2. Anti-neutrinos all have a +1/2 spin. If neutrinos are massless this isn&#039;t a problem. But since they have mass they are going slower than the speed of light and you should be able to choose a frame of reference where a -1/2 spin looks like a +1/2 spin. This would seem to convert matter to antimatter simply by a change of frame of reference.

How to deal with this seems to be what makes neutrinos so interesting.]]></description>

Is it possible to accelerate electron/muon beam into W-resonance with incoming neutrino beam? Or the required energy will be too high for any practical use?]]></description>
