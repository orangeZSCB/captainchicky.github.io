					<description><![CDATA[Belief that we need to save our world or climate has become a widespread religion in many &quot;western&quot; countries over last 10-15 years. Few people care about actual science, its progress and uncertainities. What&#039;s important is what media, ecologists or politicians say.

I don&#039;t count myself a believer of that religion although I started as one many years ago. The mistake I did was that I started thinking about it and started looking after what science has to say about it. My key conclusion, assuming the civilization will not destroy itself in its &quot;war with climate&quot;, is:

There is no way carbon emissions will be stopped. People will not stop digging oil and coal reserves and even if they find a way to propel their cars and planes and TV sets with something else, they will use fossil reserves up for other purposes and that will inevitably lead to emitting that carbon to the atmosphere one way or another.

Everything else are details. Such details like that global  temperatures have not actually risen since at least 2002 even though CO2 concentrations continue to rise at accelerated rate. Such details like that there is no proof that CO2 drives temperatures (*) but there is rather convincing evidence that temperatures drive CO2 concentrations. Such details like that even though every other extreme weather event is attributed to climate change, the amount and strength of extreme (or whatever) weather is not changing so for every extreme event attributed to climate change there is another extreme event that climate change prevented to happen. Of course, the second kind is rather hard to notice.

(*): CO2 concentration of course DOES affect temperature. CO2 is a &quot;greenhouse&quot; gas (however inaccurate that word is) and its increasing concentration increases atmosphere&#039;s thermal insulation capacity. But the question is what is the &quot;driver&quot; of the change, i.e. the cause that for instance made temperatures rise over second half of last century. And there is very little support for the hypothesis that it really was CO2. Most of belief that it is so is just that: a belief.]]></description>

Matt: I realize I haven&#039;t read all of the related posts, but I guess I&#039;m a little surprised at your talk of wanting to control this uncontrolled experiment we call life and the universe. Clearly, there&#039;s no way to have anything remotely analogous to a controlled experiment, where factors and influences are understood and known. I have a great deal of respect for your work and this blog, so maybe I&#039;m missing something.]]></description>

I think that there is only forward in that but we can adjust and I am not sure about control here either...  because we are leveling and we will make due.   It is all crazy..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post. I was checking constantly this blog and I am impressed!
Extremely useful info particularly the last part :) I care for such information 
much. I was looking for this particular info for a very long time.

Thank you and best of luck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have huge respect for prof. Strassler, thanks to his blog I&#039;ve really expanded my knowledge, but I&#039;m afraid this article, as well as the whole global warming dispute seems to neglect some facts, like it&#039;s obvious that fighting with climate change in long term (whatever the cause may be) is futile. It&#039;s Don Kichote all the way. Eventually climate WILL change, no matter if we spend billions to cut the CO2 emission, and sterilize all 3rd world countries.

To put it as simply as I can – Humanity could extinct, climate would change anyway.

Earth is not a fishtank, and never was a homeostatic environment, there&#039;s no such thing as “optimal earth temperature”, all life evolved in dynamic conditions, animals/plants/PEOPLE can live on Sahara as well as in the Arctic.

Instead of listening to politicians and energy industry lobbyists (look at differences in margins!), we should try to do what&#039;s natural, follow the instinct – adapt, evolve. That&#039;s the key, advancements in bioengineering, medicine, farming, hydrology etc. that&#039;s the only rational solution, when it&#039;s comes climate change challenges.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, I agree that cutting CO2 is necessary, but rationally, as a part of energetic independence, not  as a tool to fight (or rather slow down at best) climate change, therefore aforementioned disciplines deserve much more attention, they could provide faster, cheaper and more efficient tools for humanity to cope with different climate.

Sorry for my English.]]></description>

Indeed.  I wonder how much money has been moved in the DOE budget from HEP to green energy over the past five years?]]></description>

You should read &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; and &quot;The Rational Optimist&quot; in that order.  After reading the first, you will wonder why the world didn&#039;t end in the 80&#039;s like it was supposed to.  Reading the second will explain why and you will realize there will be no WWIII over natural resources.]]></description>

Matt,  how about a discussion on the big hurdles with various fusion designs (Tokamak, inertial confinement, muon catalyzed, Z-pinch, etc.), or better yet a discussion of the various 4th generation MSR (Molten Salt Reactor) designs for safety, waste disposal, and cost to operate.  Maybe do one reactor design a month until the LHC goes back on line.   Just a suggestion if this would be of interest you and your readers.  Thanks to Andy and Dino&#039;s comments for the idea.]]></description>
