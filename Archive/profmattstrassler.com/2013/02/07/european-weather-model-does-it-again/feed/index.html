					<description><![CDATA[I have read each of your posts with interest.  As a veteran emergency management professional (30+ years), I also wish to state that in my not so humble opinion, the NWS and more particularly the Tropical Prediction Center does an excellent job.  I can attest from practical experience beginning with Hugo on the Northeast coast of SC, that the NWS hasn&#039;t missed the mark on the track and timing of any storms during that period.  The root of the problem lies with state and local government leaders who aren&#039;t practiced in planning for, responding to and recovering from these events.  During my tenure in SC, it seemed as though we were preparing for a minimum of at least two storms each season.  You do that year after year and your practices become muscle memory.  In fact, the southeast coast, Florida and all of the gulf states, except LA, have become fairly adept at tropical storm/hurricane planning and response.  The problem with the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states is that they don&#039;t have any subject matter experts on staff who have actually managed a major hurricane let alone conducted a major evacuation or population relocation.  You couple that shortcoming with the arrival of FEMA&#039;s region III folks and you have a disaster waiting to happen, even if the storm loses its tropical characteristics.  I don&#039;t mean to be harsh on these folks, but their difficulties with Sandy could have been minimized had someone in a position of authority had sufficient experience to extrapolate the probable storm surge impacts.  Sandy is the second instance, beginning with Isabel in 2003, wherein inexperienced state and local officials didn&#039;t understand surge dynamics and how they impact coastal and other low lying areas.  That isn&#039;t a problem you can lay at the feet of the NWS.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Atmospheric pattern of “dancing rhythm”?: 
Suppose there are N non-interacting classical particles in a box, so their state can be described by the {xi(t),pi(t)}. If the particles are initially at the left of the box, they can eventually occupy the whole box according to the Newtons law. In this case, we call the gas expand and this process is irreversible.
Nevertheless, Newtons laws also have time-reversal symmetry, so we should be able to construct an initial condition such that particles occupy the whole box (i.e. not all particles in the left chamber) will all move to the left chamber. Here are the simple questions:
How to select the initial condition {xi(0),pi(0)} if you can solve the set of equation of motion.
Why the gas expansion is irreversible even though you can select the initial condition above.

since electrons and positrons can produce two W bosons, and since physics going forward in time behaves identical to physics operating backward in time (time-reversal symmetry), then two W bosons can be used to produce an electron and positron. 

Expansion of space time and time-reversal symmetry:
 The physics behind thermodynamics is perfectly reversible, but we don&#039;t see broken eggs reassembling themselves because it&#039;s extremely improbable for this to happen ?

Mark,

Indeed, I have several friends in the NWS (as well as the private sector) and one who has worked at the NHC in the past. I don&#039;t envy any of them the hot seat, especially dealing with a storm as unusual as Sandy, as you said.  No matter what forecast decision they made, some people somewhere are going to be in the short end for whatever reason.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dan D.
I&#039;ve never met Mr Bastardi and have no sense of his reputation, but he certainly nailed the Sandy forecast and deserves credit for that, not an &#039;ad hominem&#039; dismissal.
In re the quality of the NWS call, there are thousands of New Yorkers who found their cars floating along the East Side. They clearly did not get much warning about a storm surge. Nor did Con Ed, else they would not have had power on substations as they got submerged.
Overall, to claim that the Sandy forecasting was handled &#039;rather well&#039; is rewriting history, at least imho. From the perspective of the tax paying public, it was a disaster. It is hard for me to understand why this is not creating real pressure for change, especially in an institution that depends on continued public support.]]></description>

Hi etudiant,

I actually agree to some extent with you about the removal of hurricane status for Sandy.  This was indeed confusing for much of the public, even if it was technically meteorologically correct (although it wasn&#039;t a &quot;downgrade&#039;, more of a &quot;sidegrade&quot;).  I don&#039;t claim to know what the best procedure is for handling events like this, but we certainly need to reexamine this closely.  But, the city leaders should have known better, in my opinion.  Certainly they were consulting with the NHC and NWS every step of the way.  If they weren&#039;t, that&#039;s foolishness on their part, not the NWS.  But that&#039;s my opinion.

As far as Bastardi is concerned, I&#039;m sorry, but he&#039;s notorious for hyping up storms virtually every chance he can get.  It stands to reason that if one does this enough, eventually one is going to be correct.  But, he&#039;s just one private forecaster.  I have no problem with the vast majority of them, and there are certainly examples of government forecasters who have these sorts of &quot;hyping&quot; tendencies as well.

No, it wasn&#039;t the NWS&#039;s finest hour, but it was far from its worst.  How my defense of the fact that they *forecasted* the storm well--setting aside the acknowledged issues with dropping hurricane status, which really isn&#039;t a forecasting issue--can be construed as rewriting history, is beyond me.  The NWS has plenty of flaws, and Cliff Mass and others do a good job of pointing those out, but the actual *forecasting* of Sandy was handled rather well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In response to Dad D.: 
As a New Yorker, I saw that the physical and human cost of Sandy was greatly exacerbated by the foolish decision to remove Sandy from hurricane status, because of legalistic definitional hair splitting. That downgrade  certainly misled Mayor Bloomberg and the city bureaucracy and caused them to take less forceful action than they might have otherwise. The NWS warning of the storm surge risk was similarly muffled. Private forecasters such as Joe Bastardi at the Weatherbell site rang the alarm early and loudly, both concerning the likely NY area landfall as well as the storm surge potential, when the NWS was still showing Sandy dissipating out to sea. This was not the NWS&#039;s finest hour and efforts to rewrite this history should be rejected.]]></description>

http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-us-weather-prediction-computer-gap.html 

A personal observation on Sandy.  Yes, the ECMWF model did predict the unusual turn towards the East Coast before the GFS.  However, in the coming days when critical decisions to place watches and warnings along the coast, the GFS was more accurate with its U.S. landfall.  The ECMWF model was too intense and too far south, while the GFS was pretty much spot on with Sandy&#039;s landfall.]]></description>
