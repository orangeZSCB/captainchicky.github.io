					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/02/04/wednesday-sean-carroll-i-interviewed-by-alan-boyle/#comment-43174&quot;&gt;aa. sh.&lt;/a&gt;.

We&#039;ve discussed before that there is no final answer to inquiry.

However -- your use of the words &quot;effective theory&quot; is not consistent with the way physicists use the term, and that&#039;s going to confuse you in your reading.  An effective theory is one that describes long-distance, long-time phenomena (or sometimes some other class of phenomena) while averaging over other phenomena, such as shorter-distance and shorter-time phenomena.  

A physics theory is typically a set of equations that describes how an initial situation evolves to a final one --- i.e., a method for predicting, given a starting point, something about an ending point.

Most such theories --- whether effective theories or complete theories of how the world works --- do not predict the initial situation.  After all, the initial situation is typically determined by an &lt;strong&gt;experimenter&lt;/strong&gt;.

In some special circumstances people attempt to predict part of or all of the initial situation of the universe.  This type of theoretical effort is (1) in its infancy, (2) requires assuming that we have a complete or nearly complete theory of quantum gravity, which we probably don&#039;t, and (3) is extraordinarily difficult to test experimentally.  In this sense, predicting the initial conditions of the universe is on the edges of science; someday it may be done, but it is unlikely that it will be doable in our lifetimes, and it is far from clear it will ever be possible.]]></description>
