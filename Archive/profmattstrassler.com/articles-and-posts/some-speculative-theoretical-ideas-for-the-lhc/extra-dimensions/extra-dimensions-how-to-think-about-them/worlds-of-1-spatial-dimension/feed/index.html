First, hello, new fan here. I love your style, and your explanations of the concepts resonate for me. Regarding this topic...

I wonder if, in an infinite universe, the asymmetry we see between the number of protons and electrons might not be a local asymetry, specific to our own region - or if inflation is localized as well, to our own pocket? In other words does it make sense that perhaps, if you grab up a portion of particles from the universe at random, there might be an asymetry of the scale that we observe?

Two waves can indeed pass each other, in one dimension or in any other, under some conditions.  In fact you can see this in a bathtub: just make two ripples and watch them go right through.  The issue is whether the equations for the waves are like those of water waves and light (which are ``linear&#039;&#039;) or whether the equations are more complicated (``non-linear&#039;&#039;) in which case the waves will scatter, to a degree anyway.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To Dr. Matt Strassler: Q1)mechanical waves (like sound waves) seem to pass each other without collision, can any wave pass each other without collision &quot;in a true(effectively?) one-dimensional world (circle)&quot;? Why can they pass through each other without collision?  Are these waves are &quot;not&quot; in true one-dimensional world but actually in more than one dimension? and is this why they can pass each other? do they actually dodge(take two different paths) each other when they pass each other even though they effectively look like superimposed or sit/move within the same (one?) dimension? Q2)I am not sure if &quot;photons&quot; can exist in one-dimensional world but can they pass each other without collision in (true) one-dimensional world? OR they MUST ALWAYS be in 3-dimension to exist and propagate? If so why?]]></description>

Maximum &lt;strong&gt;possible&lt;/strong&gt; may well be the Planck temperature, about 10^(32) degrees Kelvin.  At temperatures that high, space itself may start to become hot, due to quantum gravitational effects, and probably you can&#039;t make things any hotter than that even in principle.  But our understanding of quantum gravity is imperfect and that argument might be wrong.

Maximum &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; may well have been much lower than this; we don&#039;t yet know enough about the cosmos to guess.  It almost certainly had to have been large enough to produce protons and neutrons and their antiparticles easily; that&#039;s about 10^(14) degrees Kelvin.  It also had to be large enough to allow an asymmetry between the number of protons and electrons and the number of anti-protons and anti-electrons (i.e. what is often called the matter-antimatter asymmetry) to arise but since we don&#039;t know how that asymmetry came about we&#039;re not sure what temperature was required.  It might be as low as 10^(14-15) degrees Kelvin but is possibly much, much larger than this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vincent,
I think you gave a good example of confusing &quot; world(s)&quot; with their abstract presentations that Matt is talking here about.

Professor,
As an aside &quot;stupid&quot; Q, what&#039;s the maximum possible T (in degrees of Kelvin), that  &quot;was&quot; in the Big Bang, I guess   ?!
What consideration could be given to assess its order of magnitude ? 

Thanks, bob  8/29/12]]></description>
