					<description><![CDATA[The phrase &quot;the representation of a circle as a closed loop inside a two-dimensional plane looks as though has an inside and an outside. But that’s a property of representing the circle inside a plane, not a property of the circle itself&quot; is most important, thank you. Please make similar notes when talking about 3-dimensional and higher analogies.

Is it a problem that to describe a point in a finite, periodic, one-dimensional world (e.g. a circle), that we are using the notion of an angle - which is a measure from a point outside the one-dimensional world? An income-line had real numbers associated with each point. Perhaps if the real angle numbers are simply assigned to the points of the circle without reference to a center point, then there is no problem. The starting point is arbitrary. But assigning a center point is assigning a point outside the dimension and that seems - problematic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Today, however, we do have the opportunity not only to observe phenomena in four and higher dimensions, but we can also interact with them. The medium for such interaction is computer graphics. Computer graphic devices produce images on two-dimensional screens. Each point on the screen has two real numbers as coordinates, and the computer stores the locations of points and lists of pairs of points which are to be connected by line segments or more complicated curves. In this way a diagram of great complexity can be developed on the screen and saved for later viewing or further manipulation .&quot; THOMAS BANCHOFF - http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html

Again I am not trying to move ahead to where I think you might be going but to fill in the gaps of where my inexperience shines as you help to orientate.

Best,]]></description>
