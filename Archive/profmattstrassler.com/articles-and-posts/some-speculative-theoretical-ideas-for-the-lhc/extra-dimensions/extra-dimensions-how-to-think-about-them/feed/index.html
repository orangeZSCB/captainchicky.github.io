					<description><![CDATA[One thing that you can do to bring a union to your company, particularly to the 
corporate level, is by sharing unique corporate Christmas gifts.
If you are giving wine or a wine gift basket, it is better 
to ask permission or get details regarding whether the person actually drinks (or might 
drink too much and not want temptation). Most of the suppliers offer home delivery feature within a few days of placing order.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[would any particle,or system existing in our known observable dimension,,,display the same properties in multiple dimensions???in other words could the same paricle appear in multiple dimensions,,,with the same Me??all at once,,,or would any system in one dimension,be missing from another...???and if subatomic particles,are multidimentional,and so far all appear as +me in our dimension,,,what would that imply about other unobservable dimensions?]]></description>

We&#039;re both right: we live in a world with 3 spatial dimensions, 1 time dimension, and, a total of 4 space-time dimensions.  Obviously one has to be clear about whether one is referring to spatial dimensions only or to the full space-time.  These types of confusions have to be carefully avoided even by professionals. Here, in these articles, I have rigorously stuck to talking about the number of spatial dimensions only.  If you want to talk about space-time that&#039;s fine --- just add one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reference to &quot; ...from the three-dimensional world we know...&quot;.

I thought we lived in a 4-D world (time) it&#039;s linear and has length.

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, let me see if I get this...The way in which I picture three dimensional space is LWH or the world around us. When I add a fourth dimension, I have always &quot;pictured&quot; a seed (a point on a line). As that seed grows, it gains width, height and lemgth. And as my imaginary tree is a Semper virens, it also gains age. Though I like the threading the needle. Can we look at the whole of threading a needle as being a 3 dimensional space, while the actual process of feeding the thread through the eye as the fourth?]]></description>
