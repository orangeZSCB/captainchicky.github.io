From Galileo to Hawking;mass,gravity,attraction,it &quot;almost&quot; seems necessary to have &#062;3D.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great blog post!!  Thank you so much for writing and sharing.  I wonder, given the precision of LIGO to measure distnaces on the order of 1 attometer, could it be adapted to measure gravity at higher precision than the current records?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact that inverse square force laws are the only kind ( AFAIK ) that lead to energy-conservative fields has made me wonder if the universe &quot;prefers&quot; three dimensions in the &quot;emergent&quot; sense. How would a space with four or more degrees of freedom even work, vis-a-vis energy conservation?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/how-to-look-for-signs-of-extra-dimensions/extra-dimensions-newtons-gravity/#comment-12401&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, for example if an improved version of Newton’s 1/(L^2) law for gravity has a 1/(L^3) term that comes into play in the 160nm range, it should be relatively easy to measure. If my intuition is correct, it will be detected as a DC current flowing in a resonating quartz crystal when the interatomic gravitational force has an external gravitational field superimposed on it.

The DC current is small and might be difficult to measure, depending on the size of the 1/(L^3) term. Based on the size of a proposed term, maybe someone can figure out how to make this measurement. If the term is large enough, it might possibly lead to a practical gravity sensor application.]]></description>

By odd-order terms you are referring to the odd orders in a 1/L expansion?  or something else?]]></description>
