					<description><![CDATA[thank you for this series, i loved the reading!

one thing bothers me though - maybe i got caught in the representation - but still; can a particle&#039;s angular momentum be considered a movement in an extra dimension? given that any movement in a scale below macro level can be hidden from our (human) perspective.

does it all boil down to scale (which seems to be determined quite arbitrarily here), or is there more to how we intrinsically define extra dimensions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, I went to the beach front with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 
year old daughter and said &quot;You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.&quot; She placed 
the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.
She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is 
entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Howdy! I know this is kind of off-topic but I needed to ask.
Does running a well-established website such as yours take a large amount of work?
I am completely new to blogging but I do write in my diary on 
a daily basis. I&#039;d like to start a blog so I will be able to share my own experience and feelings online.
Please let me know if you have any kind of ideas or tips for new aspiring blog owners.
Appreciate it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/how-to-look-for-signs-of-extra-dimensions/kaluza-klein-partners-why-step-2/#comment-41689&quot;&gt;Clarissa&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes --- with one addendum.

KK parity is a symmetry that arises when flipping the extra dimension &quot;left-to-right&quot; leaves it looking the same, in which case KK modes have a parity quantum number that has to be even in any interaction -- i.e., the interactions have to be left-to-right symmetric.  This would be true, for instance, if the extra dimension were an interval --- a finite distance with two reflecting walls.  Or if there were two extra dimensions with a non-isoceles triangle.  &lt;em&gt;[If it were isoceles there would be a order-six symmetry! --- the rotations by 120 and 240 degrees combined with flips left-to-right.]
&lt;/em&gt;

Specifically for a circular extra dimension: the symmetry is even stronger because there is translation invariance around the tube, so there is a momentum quantum number for motion in the compact direction that can be any integer.  This is a case with a U(1)_KK symmetry. In this case every KK partner has an &lt;strong&gt;integer&lt;/strong&gt; charge associated with it, no just an even or odd parity; and those charges have to add up to zero in any interaction.  So that is stronger than KK parity, where things just have to be even under the parity.  On a torus (two circles combined together) there would be two such symmetries.  Other symmetries arise on other regular surfaces, such as spheres.  The general question is: what is the symmetry of the extra dimensional space?  the KK modes will have charges under that symmetry group and the interactions will have to respect that symmetry.]]></description>
