I just realized my last question was not written well; here is the revision:

If the observer on the ship measures the ship&#039;s energy to be greater than the original rest mass from before, isn&#039;t that a violation of relativity? The observer would obviously think the kinetic component was zero.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m confused about the argument used to deduce that a 1-dimensional being on the ship will measure the energy to be greater than before.

To someone standing still outside a moving ship, the ship&#039;s energy will be greater than its rest mass because of kinetic energy. However, an observer on the ship will consider the ship to not be moving, and will measure the energy to be equal to rest mass. If the observer on the ship can somehow tell the ship is moving and therefore has a kinetic component, isn&#039;t that a violation of relativity?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great blog, Matt.  Found it while reading about Higgs.  I hope you will entertain a basic question.  So, it would seem that KK partner particles exist only in mathematical reality to satisfy an equation.  There is no real another boat with mass M&#062;m, the &quot;existence&quot; of M is based on a wrong supposition that there is no Pacross, only that E is measured to be higher.  There is no experimental way to measure M of the larger boat, and so, there is no way to experimentally measure M, M&#039;, M&quot;... for KK partner particles because they do not exist in physical reality.  How would we reconcile this with the existence of an extra dimension, which does have a physical reality?]]></description>

Your question doesn&#039;t have meaning, as stated. 

Fundamental constants are not things that dimensions have -- so what do you mean by asking whether &quot;small dimensions have the same fundamental constants&quot;?

Space is the region in which things can happen; the number of dimensions is the number of quantities needed to specify where you are.

A point or region in space can have properties such as laws of nature, constants (or local constants) that govern the behavior of physical things, etc.

But a dimension is not a point or region in space.

Think about the canal example that I&#039;ve used elsewhere: there&#039;s the long-dimension along the canal and the short-dimension along the canal.  Can you ask whether the dimension that is associated with motion across the canal has a different electron mass than does the long direction?  that&#039;s not a meaningful question.  

I can ask whether points near one side of the canal have electrons with the same mass as do points near the other side.  But that&#039;s a different question.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you so sure that small dimensions have the same fundamental constants? --- And the same fields and force carriers that we know so well?  Is there symmetry or a transfer function for how the same thing &quot;looks&quot; from one side or the other in that small dimension?]]></description>

No, you had it right on the tube; there is a conservation law there.  See my comments elsewhere about KK partners of the photons potentially being dark matter.]]></description>
