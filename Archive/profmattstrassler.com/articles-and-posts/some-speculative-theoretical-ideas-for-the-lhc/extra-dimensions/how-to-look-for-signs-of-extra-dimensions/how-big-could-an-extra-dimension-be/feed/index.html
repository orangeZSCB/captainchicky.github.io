					<description><![CDATA[Quote:
&quot;If all known particles were able to move in an extra dimension, then the atoms out of which we are made, and the light that we see, could move around in more than three dimensions. Clearly these dimensions can’t be infinite in size, or macroscopic in size, or we’d see them, literally; we could turn our heads in the direction of that extra dimension, just as we can turn our heads to the right or look down out our feet, and our eyes could absorb photons coming from that direction, just as they can see light coming from the horizon or from overhead. Since we don’t see them, any such extra dimensions have to be finite in extent and microscopic.&quot;

I&#039;m sorry, but I think you can be wrong on this because you make an assumption that maybe it is not true. You assumed that the extra dimensions have the same properties as our commonly three dimensions. But what if not?

What make me to consider about this possibility is the fact that we don&#039;t have until now any evidence that our commonly three dimensions have any limitations about their size (or I am not aware about such limitations). If I remember right, our evidence are telling us that the Universe if flat with an margin of error less than 2%. If it will be proved that the space is perfectly flat doesn&#039;t mean it is infinite in size, I know that. Anyway, what I am trying to tell is that if we don&#039;t have limitations of the space size for the regular dimensions why to think they exist for extra dimensions? 

So, I asked myself what else it is characteristic for our space? And the answer is: the speed of light. How the Universe is influenced by the value of c? Because the value of c is the speed limit for any kind of interactions, its value determines in fact the speed of time passing. If I am not wrong, the value of c came from Maxwell equations and it is an attribute of the vacuum (is related to the electric constant ε0 and the magnetic constant μ0 by the equation c = 1/√ε0μ0). By the way, how the quantum mechanics theory generate the value for c (if it do that)?

What if in this hypothetical extra dimensions an other value for c exist (because different ε0 and/or μ0 or by other causes)? Let say that the value of c&#039; (the speed of light in the extra dimensions) is 50 orders smaller than to value of our c, c&#039;=c x 10-50. 
If so, we can say that the time flows 50 times slower than in our dimensions, so, if the Universe is about 4,3 x 10+17 seconds old from the normal dimensions perspective, it is only 10-33 seconds old from the extra dimensions perspective. With other words, maybe the Universe is in the extra dimensions in a state similar with what we believe existed before Inflationary epoch (before 10-36 seconds from the origin of Universe) when the space as we know today simple doesn&#039;t existed yet. Maybe the extra dimensions Universe is small just because not enough time passed yet to became observable. Or, maybe we do not observe (using our senses or our instruments) the extra dimensions simply because for us nothing notable was happened yet there. For us it is a &quot;frozen&quot; Universe.
If this is the case, we will never observe the KK partners for the regular particles because they do not exist. 

I don&#039;t know if this hypothesis is falsifiable or what predictions can be made using it, this is far beyond my possibilities. I just wonder if there is any evidence that it is wrong.

Sorry for my mistakes, I&#039;m not a native English speaker.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eek!  My plan to do a science experiment on the cheap is running into reality.  I just checked with a supplier of niobium and the minimum size piece they sell, suitable for the experiment, would be 150 dollars.  That&#039;s for a 1/4 inch rod 6 inches long.  But I only need an inch or less.  Not sure I could resell the remainder that I don&#039;t use.  Any suggestions about where to find a small piece of niobium are welcome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, thanks to both you and Glen Martin for the answers to my questions at the other blog.

I just received an answer to my question about superconductor acceleration signals.  Dr. Adelberger stated that his Eot-Wash group has not done any experiments to test the superconductor acceleration signal claims of Dr. Tajmar and his group, or similar experiments by Evgeny Podkletnov (who I also mentioned in the email).  He also said that he looked carefully at the papers by the Austrian group and didn&#039;t find them convinicing.

So now I&#039;m thinking if I can do this experiment on the cheap I might just go ahead and try it.  It&#039;s undoubtedbly a long shot, but performing the experiments will satisfy my own curiousity.  Control tests will have to be part of the experiment, such as repeating the experiment, when the niobium rises above its critical temperature, all other conditions being identical.  I also will need to make absolutely sure that any acceleration signal observed is not from some other source, such as an acoustic impulse.  I can see I have my work cut out for me.

I may know of a lab that uses liquid helium.  In 2005 I was contracted to work as a technician by a former Woods Hole Oceanographic scientist.  He is now a professor of Environmental Engineering at Columbia University.  I did part of the work at the Lamont-Doherty Research facility in Palisades, NY.  I believe the Chemistry group there uses liquid helium.  There&#039;s also the possibiliy that the Biology department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute uses liquid helium.  I am still a casual employee there, and used to fill my dewar with liquid nitrogen in that department, back in 2009 when I was conducting experiments with YBCO discs.]]></description>
