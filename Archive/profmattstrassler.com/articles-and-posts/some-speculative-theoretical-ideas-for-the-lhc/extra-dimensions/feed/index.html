					<description><![CDATA[Space is infinite, at least classically, but the 3 spatial dimensions still are acceptable for describing it in my opinion. Rather one travels east or west visa-vis the poles has no bearing on any presumed x-y-z coordinates, only the direction of presumed observation. Not being a scientist a may get a reply of some sort that there is no independent point of observation, I believe Einstein made that point, but is that not for real observations, theoretically one can presume  any point one wants? 

from another website
&quot;As the tree trunks get narrower, the dimensions of your world reduce from two to one&quot;.
my reply
This is entirely untrue. Making an object smaller never changes its relational parameters, Further in the example the curvilinear shape lies within the 3-dimensions of space. But I perhaps see now where these false ideas are mathematically formed. Because i assume one can make formulas for shapes, etc, but to say they are &quot;dimensions&quot; is incorrect in my opinion. I go over inconsistent logic like this in my Book Hypothetical Collisions of an Ideal Solid, that is my updated book, not what on the web, but as an E-book at Lulu.com entitled A NON FICTION TRILOGY. It is this inconsistent logic that fails physics from making a unified theory, while still having the parameters/mathematics  figured on most phenomena.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Joe Chan

Back from a lot of work in France, here is my answer.

Dimensions like length, width and height shape, are decisive factors for, spatial objects like cubes. They are not endogenous however. They don&#039;t &quot;work together&quot; out of their own.

What are the dimensions that shape the world? Directions like up/down, back/forward, left/right? Are thery relevant in space? If I go due &quot;east&quot;, the &quot;South Pole is at my right. If I go due &quot;west&quot;, the &quot;South Pole is at my left.You don&#039;t find x, y and z in space. You find them in geometry books.

So, talking about spatial dimensions, the point in question as far as I am concerned is what dimensions/properties of the world/decisive factors shape the world endogenously, being generic and not independent, their proportions being fully interrelated., continuously changing each other&#039;s proprtions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;If one of the three dimensions of the cube changes, the other two have to change as well, otherwise the cube is not a cube anymore&quot;
Marten: are you confusing &#039;dimension&#039; with &#039;length&#039; ?  Should your statement read: If the length of 1 of the 3 sides of the cube changes, the other 2 have to change as well, otherwise the cube is not a cube anymore.  This is a true statement but it involves simple geometry &#038; proportions of a cube and not dimensions.
I also do not agree that time, energy and mass are &#039;dimensions&#039;.  We are talking about spatial dimensions as in left/right, forward/backward &#038; up/down.....  (x, y &#038; z coordinates for the 3 dimensions).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As example I take a cube. If one of the three dimensions of the cube changes, the other two have to change as well, otherwise the cube is not a cube anymore. This means that the dimensions of the cube are not independent. If one dimension changes the inescapable changes of the other two dimensions are fully predictable One could say that a cube is an intelligent design. Space however is not. The directions in space are the same as the directions of time.Energy and mass do affect time and space: the curvature of space-time,  an acumulation of events..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[IThank you.

&quot;No, I am afraid ......incorrect.&quot;

If this is your answer to my &quot;I don&#039;t think .......... independent.&quot;, I don&#039;t understand it. Are dimensions like length, width and height not independent.? Are events caused or affecred by such dimensions?

&quot;You say ....&quot; etc.

I need more time to think about that. For the time being I like to mention that any event originating in a particular point at a particular moment will unfold histories from that point and that moment on into each and every direction,  thereby creating space.. So  I don&#039;t see the problem you mention with regard to the notion of past (and future in space.]]></description>
