					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Joe Layman here. It seems like the end result of supersymmetry is that half of this universe is superluminal and we don&#039;t have the ability to conceptualize it, which is why we have zeros and infinities in our math. Perhaps we need to consider an algebraic math as fundamental, and digital math is the real entropy; thus explaining the need for zeros and infinities in our work.]]></description>

No.  First of all, a positron has the *opposite* charge of an electron, not the *same* charge like a selectron.  Second, a positron is a fermion, whereas a selectron is a boson (that&#039;s the whole idea of supersymmetry).

The positron is just the antiparticle of the electron.  That means it&#039;s mathematically kind of like having &quot;one less electron than none at all&quot;.  That doesn&#039;t have anything to do with supersymmetry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, I doubt this thread is still active, but come across it and am curious as to a section. It states that we would have known if there was  a particle with the same mass as an electron ages ago, but we do. In 1929 the Positron was theorized and later proven to exist. Is this not what was being alluded to? How does this change the state of the argument?

Thanks.]]></description>
