					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Matt.  I&#039;m actually writing a screenplay involving the LHC (and a &quot;B-story&quot; involving a fatal car crash, lost love, and saving the universe).  I&#039;m not a physicist, but am relatively good at math, went through Leonard Susskind&#039;s numerous YouTube lectures, and read a lot on the subject.

I stumbled into your excellent website through a web search that now escapes me, but THANK YOU for your discussion and descriptions.  The concepts of how things combine are accessible through some matrix algebra, but I always feel like the math leaves me walking backward.  I don&#039;t feel like particles decay so much as contribute energy back to one of the four forces.

So, I&#039;m looking at some &quot;decay&quot; charts and LOVE the one surmising a D0 meson along with a couple of other particles.  because it is neutral, it doesn&#039;t show up in the bubble chamber.  Does it seem as if it&#039;s an odd angle to be shooting out from the other trails?  https://www.britannica.com/science/subatomic-particle/Charged-leptons-electron-muon-tau/media/570533/3051

Because the bubble chambers only record what they&#039;re set to record (at our current level of technology), I wonder if some of the energy is disappearing backward from the initiation of the trails (yes... backward in time) or being exchanged with another universe.  I think we&#039;ve captured symmetric particles in other experiments, but I can help but feel there&#039;s something missing here besides a neutral meson.

Your thoughts?]]></description>

It completely changes how Fight for Your Life works, by giving 
you a bundle of dynamite to use to kill an enemy and allowing you to move at full speed.

Yes, it will be quite a while before I turn to this topic.  I still have a huge amount to do to make the site fully usable for laypersons.  The focus of this site for most of the rest of the year will definitely be the search for new phenomena in LHC proton-proton collisions.  To explain the physics of heavy-ion collisions and dense QCD would be a whole project in and of itself, requiring many articles.... and for a paper such as you just quoted, some study, as I have not been following this particular issue closely.   But I&#039;ll try to remember to mention it if I learn something about it at a conference.]]></description>

Quark Propagation Through Cold QCD Matter


A quantitative understanding of quark energy loss is essential to make deﬁnitive statements about the observations of jet quenching in relativistic heavy-ion collisions; there are numerous additional complications for a hot plasma that are not present for cold nuclei, such as thermal gluon absorption by propagating partons, and a highly non-equilibrated environment. Fluctuations in the number of radiated gluons have been suggested to be very important for understanding the radiated energy loss of the highest energy jets, based on the ﬁrst data from RHIC. It has also been suggested that the cone of outgoing particles associated with a struck quark is much broader for hot, dense nuclear matter than for cold.]]></description>
