					<description><![CDATA[I do agree with all of the concepts you have introduced for your post.
They are very convincing and will definitely work. Still, the posts 
are too brief for novices. May just you please extend them a 
bit from subsequent time? Thanks for the post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone,

As I understand it, information can be very twisted or mangled, but it cannot be destroyed, which happens to be a consequence of information entropy (which is just a particular form that the general law of entropy has regarding information).

It is clear that information from events way into the past of our Universe are really twisted and mangled by the high energies involved during the initial moments of the Big Bang, and that the process of inflation did not help with this either, at the same time we cannot assume that the information is not &quot;out there&quot;, even though it could be really distorted in such a way that we do not comprehend well (yet).

After all, this very same argument is what proved Stephen Hawking wrong regarding entropy within black holes.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/what-do-current-mid-august-2011-lhc-results-imply-about-supersymmetry/#comment-2904&quot;&gt;zakaria&lt;/a&gt;.

Your question is a good one.  The issues are (a) whether anything that we can actually measure carries information about the distant past, and (b) whether any process that occurred between the early universe and the present might have erased or scrambled the information beyond recovery.

One problem for us is that the universe was so hot and dense during the Big Bang that it erased much of the information that we might have obtained from that extremely early period.  The period of inflation that may have preceded the hot dense period (see below) erased information even more effectively.  However, that said, we&#039;re actually doing pretty well

1) The cosmic background microwave radiation (the cold photons left over from the hot Big Bang) tells us a lot about what the universe was doing 100,000 years after the Big Bang

2) If we could measure the cosmic microwave neutrinos (which is a problem of practice, not one of principle --- no one has figured out how to do it) that would tell us more details about what the universe was doing just a few minutes after the Big Bang.

3) By studying the bumps and wiggles in the distribution of the microwave radiation across the sky, and studying a few other properties of the current universe, we can infer, by running Einstein&#039;s equations for the universe backward in time, something about what was happening from 100,000 years back to a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang began.  This is the period at the end of inflation, which probably occurred in the Universe&#039;s history (though this is not yet certain), during which the universe was cold and expanding at a spectacular rate, and following which the universe became hot and dense, and continued expanding more slowly.  Not surprisingly, however, the further we go back, the more assumptions we have to make, and the less sure we are of our understanding.

4) Eventually we may understand the inflationary period well enough to be confident that we have the right equations for it (or perhaps, we&#039;ll replace inflation with a more correct history.)  Maybe that understanding will permit us to go back further, but until we have it, there&#039;s no way to know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr strassler I hope you are in good health , I would like to ask a question keeps coming to my mind quit frequently , and i hope you answer it to me , since we can receive all types of signals from the universe why can not we receive anything that confirms exactly what happened at the moment this universe was born? and why there is nothing coming from the universe that talks about any possible past universes ? and please pardon my language .
best regards .]]></description>
