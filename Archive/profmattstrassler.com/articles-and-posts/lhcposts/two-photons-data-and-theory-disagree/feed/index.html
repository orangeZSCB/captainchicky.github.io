					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/two-photons-data-and-theory-disagree/#comment-1797&quot;&gt;Sid&lt;/a&gt;.

In general, it is almost as hard to estimate the size of the error on one’s approximation as it would be to improve the approximation directly.

One reason is that theoretical calculations of this type tend to involve the computation of various quantities which partially cancel. A close analogy: suppose I wanted to calculate a function f(x) for x less than 1 (but not too much less than 1), but I only knew how to calculate it as a series expansion: f(x) = 3 + 2x + order(x^2). A better approximation would be obtained if I could calculate the next term: f(x) = 3 + 2 x + c x^2 + order(x^3) — which would require me to calculate c. Alternatively, if I want to know how accurate my original approximation of 3 + 2x is, I just need to *estimate* c. But if it turns out that my calculation of c is of the form c = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5 where c1 = 10 and c2 = -17 and c3 = +12 and c4 = -22 and c5 = 15, so that c = -2, I would not get a very good estimate if I tried to take a short cut and just calculate c1 alone. In such a situation, the size of c — which determines how good my original approximation is — is very difficult to guess; with all those cancellations, it could easily have turned out to be +6 or -0.3 instead of -2, which would make the approximation either much worse or much better than it actually turns out to be.]]></description>
