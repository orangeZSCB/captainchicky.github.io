					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/a-historic-day-or-just-an-important-one/#comment-34&quot;&gt;Charlie&lt;/a&gt;.

The Tevatron data isn&#039;t inconsistent with what LHC sees, and it makes a weak case a little stronger, but not by much.  And the Tevatron will only collect 1.5 times as much data as it already has before it is shut down in September --- so it isn&#039;t going to help much in future.  The key to the future is that LHC will collect perhaps &lt;strong&gt;four times&lt;/strong&gt; more data by the end of the year, and a factor of 10 or more by the end of next year (knock on wood or whatever is your favorite material.)  That will put the Tevatron out of business except at the very low-mass end, around 115-120 GeV..  So, except for this low-mass region, it is the LHC which is likely to get this all straight, with relatively little help from the Tevatron.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s this news I hear on the BBC that the Tevatron has shown similar evidence in it&#039;s data? I suppose this is helpful for your point 1) as it is more data. How about 2) to 4)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Am I correct in thinking that the approximately 2 sigma and 1.2 sigma excess in H -&#062; WW seen by ATLAS and CMS respectively in the range 120 - 140 GeV, and especially in the lower part of this range, could be a hint of an SM Higgs plus a 4th left-handed SM generation, which according to page 5 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3718&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kribs et al&lt;/a&gt;, would increase sigma x BR for H -&#062; WW by a factor of about 5.5 relative to the SM value in this range?  For if it was just an SM Higgs with 3 generations, it would not be expected to be able to push the ATLAS exclusion limit up from the expected 2 sigma_SM to 4 sigma_SM at 130 GeV, for example.  But a 120 GeV Higgs plus a 4th generation would almost fit.]]></description>
