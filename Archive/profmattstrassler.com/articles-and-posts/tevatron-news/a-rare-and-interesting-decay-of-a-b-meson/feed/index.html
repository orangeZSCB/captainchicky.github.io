					<description><![CDATA[With havin so much content do you ever run into any problems of plagorism or copyright violation? My website has 
a lot of exclusive content I&#039;ve either created myself 
or outsourced but it seems a lot of it is popping it up 
all over the web without my permission. Do you know any ways to help reduce content from being ripped off?
I&#039;d truly appreciate it.]]></description>

This hands on analyis is very intresting and educative. Any new results that confirm or infirm hypothesis A or B?
You have made many of my days lately, I have read most of your articles. Big thank you for your effort in clarifying many concepts, laying a solid and serious ground.
