					<description><![CDATA[Another possibility is that undetected seismic activities (possibly even from Yellowstone area) disrupt the flow of energy on regular intervals, like a pulse. Energy seems to be fluid in its behavior, inasmuch, same energies always produce  the same particles. What if particle is nothing more than a micro drop of energy that as soon as separation occurs, due to laws of QCD, it also assumes a charge. The charges of quark-antiquark and gluon-antigluon pairs is always in ratio of 1/3. The three main quarks absorb all the excessive energies and thus have larger mass. What keeps this consistency in the proton?

One question; do these collisions occur in nature ie., in supernova explosions? 
P.S.
Yes, I know tevatron was closed in September 2011. Do you know what reason was given?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If energy created by the tevatron in these collisions is always at the same level, and protons have fixed number of particles then the cause of asymmetry could be either one of the following; tevatron cables are damaged and need replacing, EM energy is not constant even though it is expected to be, protons do not have a fixed number of quark-antiquark  and gluon- antigluon pairs. May be nature is not as precise as the mathematical equation requires them to be. In the last case, particles must have ability to compensate for these naturally occurring inconsistencies.]]></description>

Not a dumb question.  But in fact the way that top quarks are produced would not give you the effect you want; your intuition is off because the production of a top quark occurs (dominantly) through a single virtual gluon, which eliminates the forward-versus-backward distinction.   You need another source.  Moreover, if compositeness gave such a large effect as is being observed, it would be observable in other measurements; but (as of July 2012 -- there&#039;s much more LHC data now than there was when this article was first written) no effect is seen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is probably a dumb question, but suppose the top quarks and top antiquarks were themselves composite particles, so the scattering cross section form factor was dependent on the momentum transfer. Then wouldn&#039;t this favor forward scattering ( 90 degrees in cm)?]]></description>
