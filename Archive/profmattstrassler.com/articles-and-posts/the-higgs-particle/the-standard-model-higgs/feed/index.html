					<description><![CDATA[Professor Strassler,
What is the current status regarding the role or relevance of Higgs field as related to the model(s) of origin of our universe, vis-a-vis the Big Bang Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, or any other models?
How such conceived roles, if any, stack against the widely accepted role on mass of elementary particles? 
Thank you for comments.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Dr.Stassler,
The 5th point, &quot;[Note: if you have read somewhere that the Higgs particle gives mass to the other particles, you should disregard it. That statement is simply wrong.  The Higgs field does that job.]&quot;
I remember that you said when a top-left quark (left chirality) meets a Higgs bosob and then turn into a top-right quark, and turns back (like oscillation). According to the 5th point statement, that statement about meeting Higgs bosons is not an exact statement but just an approximation?]]></description>
