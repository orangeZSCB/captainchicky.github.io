					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/decay-to-unusual-jets/#comment-11530&quot;&gt;Mike Anthis&lt;/a&gt;.

This is a very long story.  Testing strategies are very complex; you need to talk to real experts in triggering about that.  

There&#039;s no need to run the collider with small numbers of bunches (although in early 2010 that was done as the machine started up); for example, it would be enough, while running at full power, to take every 10 billionth collision at random.  Something like this is done; trigger strategies include, for instance, keeping ALL events with a photon whose energy (actually, transverse momentum) is greater than 80 GeV, but keeping every tenth event with a photon whose energy is greater than 50 GeV, etc.  

Triggering simulation is indeed a crucial part of making sure the trigger&#039;s effects are well-understood and that all its strategies are working properly.  Simulation of the experimental detector, of the collisions, of the trigger, and of both standard and possible novel phenomena are all key elements in ensuring the experiments function and in carrying out measurements.]]></description>
