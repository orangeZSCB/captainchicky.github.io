					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt

How does the formula &quot;T = h / m c2&quot;  apply to photons (and gluons)?

Is the &#039;T&#039; the particle&#039;s proper time? If so, then your discussion would seem to indicate that photons have an infinite mass width.

This might be related to another question I have been wondering about for a while: how is it that photons come in many different varieties (with different wavelengths), whereas electrons all have the same wavelength.  I&#039;ve never heard of anyone discussing varying frequency/wavelength for particles other than photons (even the other massless particles).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/#comment-6101&quot;&gt;Charles Rezk&lt;/a&gt;.

What I did was convert mass to a time T, because people know about mass and can think about heartbeats as an analogy.

What we do as professionals is instead convert lifetime to an &quot;uncertainty&quot; in the particle&#039;s mass, known as a *width* [denoted &#915;] because when you measure a particle&#039;s mass through a bump in a distribution, the width of that distribution is the intrinisic uncertainty in the particle&#039;s mass.  Note the term ``uncertainty&#039;&#039; here is technical and not English; we physicists may know the mass of a particular type of particle with great certainty, but when you produce a particle of this type its mass will be a little different each time, with the average being what we call the &quot;mass&quot; and the width of the distribution of masses being what we call the &quot;width&quot;.  It&#039;s a physical &quot;uncertainty&quot;, not an epistemelogical one, and it is intrinsic to nature, not to scientists.  The shorter the lifetime, the larger this intrinsic uncertainty in the mass.

So the relevant ratio in professional particle physics is width/mass: how &quot;intrinsically uncertain&quot; is the particle&#039;s mass compared to its mass.]]></description>
