					<description><![CDATA[Hello just wanted to give you a quick heads up.
The text in your content seem to be running 
off the screen in Ie. I&#039;m not sure if this is a formatting issue or something to do with web browser compatibility but I figured I&#039;d post to let you 
know. The layout look great though! Hope you get the issue fixed soon.
Cheers]]></description>

There&#039;s no such thing, unfortunately.  The lists are complicated, proprietary [i.e. secret], constantly changing, and subtle. I work directly with experimentalists and therefore have a rough idea (but not details) of the types of strategies they are using.

Your best bet is to look for a talk where an experimentalist has sketched out the basic trigger strategies used in late 2011 by one or the other experiment.  Everything written there will be 50% wrong by omission of subtleties, but at least it will be 50% right.

Maybe one of my experimental colleagues has a better suggestion.]]></description>
