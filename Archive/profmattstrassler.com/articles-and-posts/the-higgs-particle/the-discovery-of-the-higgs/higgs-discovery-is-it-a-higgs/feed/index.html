					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much. 

I&#039;m 17 and I live in the Netherlands. If you finish high school here, you have to write an essay about a subject. You are free to choose any subject you want, and we (me and a friend) chose to write an essay about the higgs discovery. After writing alot about CERN, the standard model and a lot(!) more, we still had no clue how they found the higgs particle. We understood what it was and why it was hard to detect. We still had no clue how it was detected...


Then we found your site, you are a legend.

We understand now how they found the higgs particle, This is the clearest explanation I&#039;ve found on the internet.

(sorry for my English, it isn&#039;t my primairy language)]]></description>

This is complicated and sophisticated; it involves subtle theorems in quantum field theory.  It certainly isn&#039;t obvious.  That&#039;s why I didn&#039;t say much about it.  Sorry I don&#039;t have a better explanation for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting and clear as usual!

Just a question. When you say &quot;There are various theoretical reasons to expect lightweight elementary particles to have spin no greater than 2, and for the only particle of spin 2 to be the graviton.&quot; ... what reasons do you have in mind? Thanks in advance.]]></description>

1. There is no connection between the Higgs field and gravity, so there will be no impact on LIGO.  [Many people think &quot;Higgs -- mass -- gravity&quot;, but this is an error: First, gravity is always universal (affects all particles) while the Higgs field is not universal: it only provides mass for the known particles, while other hypothetical particles, including perhaps dark matter particles, likely get their masses in other ways.  Even the Higgs particle gets only part of its mass from the Higgs field; the other part of its mass is not predicted by the Standard Model&#039;s equations and its source is therefore unknown.  Second, gravity in Einstein&#039;s theory is not about mass, as Newton&#039;s is; it is about energy and momentum.  For slow particles, energy and mass are proportional (E is approximately m c-squared if a particle moves with speed slow compared to light-speed) so that&#039;s why the difference between Newton&#039;s theory and Einstein&#039;s are hard to notice in ordinary life.  But it&#039;s crucial to understand this distinction.  So you should think: Higgs --- non- universal giver of mass to the known particles, and partly itself; gravity --- universal force that arises from the energy and momentum of all types of particles.

2. Like the photon and the Z particle, the Higgs boson is its own antiparticle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Two questions.

1.  Will the discovery of the Higgs-Boson at 125 GeV/c2, and all of the other discoveries that you have outlined above, help to &quot;tune&quot; LIGO when it switches back on?

2. If there is a Higgs-Boson...can there be an anti-Higgs-Boson?]]></description>
