Alex, your last sentence is true for a single reference frame, but if the acceleration is happening in a reference frame that itself is accelerating, and both for instance are accelerating away from you can make a thing move faster than c of the original reference frame. Time/motion is relative and that is the key to understanding what I&#039;m referring to. Very massive objects, such as a black hole, can easily accelerate massive objects to velocities beyond the speed of light of an originating reference frame. 

In my mind, there is no reason to refer to any entity that moves (and isn&#039;t a shadow) as being massless. But physics has had a long history of not fully understanding the relativity of time and has been entangled with the idea that if it moves at the speed of light in our reference frame that it should be massless. My mentioning of the above comments, particularly with black holes, should be revealing of the inconsistency still plaguing physics theories.]]></description>

Hi,
Just have to comment this, because my intuition just got broken. I can understand a field in regard to which you do not move by consider it &quot;outside space&quot; or having the same value everywhere. I have big problems understanding a field which has different values in space and with regard to which you cannot move.
I accept the fact that light speed is constant although my mind cannot model that intuitively.
But then a stupid question raises: what is the speed of a photon in relation to the Higgs field ?
Any answer that would help me patch my intuition is appreciated.]]></description>

The uncertainty principle is an inevitable result of particles actually being waves in quantum fields. We know why it exists and behaves as it does.

In short, if you want to know where something  (that is, a wave) is, you must stop it moving about, and the only way to do that perfectly is to bump it from all sides infinitely much, which means its speed becomes infinitely uncertain. (You can see this in a circular cup of water, tap the side right and a wave will form on the outside and move in from all directions into the center of the cup.)

On the other hand if you want to know the speed of something you need an infinitely big space to measure it, so you can be absolutely, totally sure. (Imagine trying to measure the speed of a wave in a cup, where it is always bouncing around and hitting the sides vs measuring the speed of a wave in the ocean where it can take a long time to hit the shore.)

Both of those examples are total lies, but they&#039;re a nice start, you really need to understand a bit about waves and how they work before the truth of the uncertainty principle becomes obvious. (For a long time I had no idea how it worked.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Professor,

A wonderful FAQ written in a lighthearted fashion. But I have a question (Of course.)

Given your explanations of how a nonzero Higgs field mixed particles I had got the impression that the Higgs particle (Or virtual equivalents) caused mass but now I think I may have to adjust my thinking. Can you tell me which (if any) of these ways of looking at things is most accurate?

1.) Particles are constantly swapping between left and right types really, really fast so on longer timescales it looks like they are an average of the two (Much like how a proton looks elemental when seen on nuclear scales but can be seen to be composite when examined on smaller scales.)

2.) The nonzero Higgs field allows the left and right particle fields to affect each other so that ripples in one field  inevitably cause ripples in the other and vic versa. (Much like how two objects in a vacuum  can&#039;t pass (much) heat between them, but if the air pressure field&#039;s value increases they can pass heat between each other more efficiently until eventually warming one inevitably brings both rapidly to the same temperature.)

3.) The Higgs field causes the left and right particle fields (or particles) to become indistinguishable no matter how they are measured. (That is they are not swapping back and forth between two distinct states really quickly but the two states themselves have become indistinguishable.)

4.) The nonzero Higgs filed causes the left and right particle fields themselves to combine so the two fields become one and the particles we know are ripples in that filed. (Not like the proton field which, though composite does not remove the quark and gluon fields from independent existence.)]]></description>

We don&#039;t need to.

We already know how much dark energy there is; this is obvious by looking out at the universe and seeing how it works. (Same with dark matter, we know that if there was only normal matter galaxies would fly apart; &#039;something&#039; has to be holding them together and extra &#039;hidden\dark&#039; matter is a good bet.) The question is what IS dark energy? (Likewise, &#039;dark matter&#039; may just be gravity acting wonky on a universal scale, though that possibility seems to be fading fast. (Look up MOND or Modified Newtonian Dynamics))

The comsological constant is one of the worst predictions in physics; when you add up all the energy that empty space should have you end up with a figure far, far FAR bigger than a billion, billion, billion times what is actually observed.

Since our results of what we calculate dark energy to be are so off the chances are that explanation is also off and pulling apart our terribly, terribly wrong result into different bits will just give us more wrong answers. When we come up with a theory for dark energy that isn&#039;t such a horrible failure equation-wise, THEN we can start prying it apart to see what&#039;s what.]]></description>

No.

The problem with this idea is that slight curves are large curves and the effect you want is very small (In size.) Think of the earth, it it slightly positively curved and looks flat to us. An egg is much more highly curved and is obviously curved to us. For the Higgs field to do anything like what you suggest it would have to massively curve space and this really, really doesn&#039;t work. (Everything gets all curled up into a tiny dot.)

As stated before, the Higgs Mechanism is a well known way to give particles mass supported by plenty of equations and predications. it doesn&#039;t explain all mass, but it does a very good job.]]></description>

&quot;Wouldn’t such a field be stationary in one frame but not in any other? Or is my ‘picture’ of a field missing something?&quot;

No.  The Higgs field is not like an ordinary medium, like air.  It is stationary in all inertial frames, from the point of view of all observers... like the vacuum itself.  You can think of it (and all scalar fields) as an adjustable property of the vacuum.

Regarding mass and gravity: Newton&#039;s theory of gravity involves mass, but Einstein&#039;s does not.

1) In Einstein&#039;s theory of gravity, it is *energy* that gravitates, not mass.   So gravity pulls on all energy, including the energy of massless particles, such as photons.  In short, all particles gravitate whether or not they have mass.  You can make a black hole out of massless particles.

2) The Higgs field provides mass (in a way that I&#039;m going to explain in future articles on this site) to some particles.  Particles that are at rest have E = m c-squared, so for particles that don&#039;t move much or at all (such as the atoms that make up the earth) the energy and mass of particles are proportional.  That&#039;s why Einstein&#039;s theory of gravity gives the same answer as Newton&#039;s, to a good approximation, for things like the earth.  All the Higgs field is doing, from this point of view, is changing the energy of certain particles. This changes the details of how they gravitate.  But they were already able to gravitate.

Logically, (1) comes before (2).  Gravity is universal; the Higgs field only provides mass to most known particles, and probably does not provide mass to others we haven&#039;t discovered yet, such as dark matter.  

In fact, the Higgs field does not provide all of the mass of the Higgs particle!  There is an additional source whose details are not known, but which has to be there.]]></description>
