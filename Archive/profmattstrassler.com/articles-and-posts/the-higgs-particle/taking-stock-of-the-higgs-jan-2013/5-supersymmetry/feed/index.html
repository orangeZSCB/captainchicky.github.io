					<description><![CDATA[Professor, you wrote:

&quot;One reason supersymmetry is popular is that it apparently makes Einstein’s old puzzle, of how to combine gravity with the other forces into a consistent whole, somewhat easier to solve.&quot;

Am I interpreting this correctly by saying, if a particle exists to &quot;unify&quot; all the fundamental forces, including gravity, then that particle must be a superpartner of itself, perfectly identical?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can I simply just say what a comfort to uncover somebody who truly understands what they&#039;re discussing on the net.

You certainly realize how to bring an issue to light and make 
it important. More and more people should look at this and understand
