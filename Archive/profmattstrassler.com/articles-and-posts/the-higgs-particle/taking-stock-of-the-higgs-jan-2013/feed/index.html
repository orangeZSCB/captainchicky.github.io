Hmm... I&#039;m honestly really confused.  I feel like we&#039;re talking at cross-purposes, but can&#039;t quite figure out why.

My only and entire point about Higgs --&#062; two photons is that it proves the Higgs isn&#039;t colored or charged [i.e., carries no electric monopole or color monopole charge.]  Now I know you&#039;re not disagreeing with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.  

I think you&#039;re trying to say that Higgs --&#062; two photons does not prove the Higgs isn&#039;t composite; and that if it is composite, what it is made from may carry charge or color.  And I of course agree with that.  I certainly didn&#039;t say the Higgs &lt;strong&gt;isn&#039;t&lt;/strong&gt; composite and internally-strongly coupled; in fact I have a whole section about that: https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/2-perhaps-composite/  And in such a scenario, the Higgs is very much like a neutral pion, with similar properties.

So when you say &quot;digging a hole in trying to draw a conclusion&quot; -- I am puzzled about what conclusion you&#039;re talking about, or how I am digging the hole.  I don&#039;t think the conclusions I&#039;m drawing differ from yours.  Please clarify... thanks!]]></description>

Matt; there&#039;s a problem with trying to write for non-experts without introducing other demons, but here I think one may be digging a hole in trying to draw a conclusion that actually requires rather a lot of deep argument. The Higgs (even a colour neutral elementary Higgs, which is what this beast may well be) couples to quarks (top antitop in particular) which is what drives the two gamma decay. It is the strength of the H to quarks coupling that is what matters. The production and decay rates at LHC are consistent with that coupling being &quot;standard Higgsish&quot; (i.e. not strong); simply seeing it decay to two gammas cannot allow one to draw the conclusion that the beast is not strong. Now I dont know how to go through all that and retain the interest of a general reader (!) but I also am uneasy at drawing inferences without doing so. Its one of the many hazards of popularization (I like your article very much by the way, and this is one of the issues that I would like to find a neat way of explaining myself)]]></description>

Sorry, I was rushing the last answer and should have done a better job.

The main difference between a top-prime (and as I said that is a provisional name --- over the years lots of things have been called &quot;top-prime&quot; for different reason) and a fourth-generation quark is that a fourth generation quark gets its mass from the Higgs field (just the way quarks of the other three generations do) but a top-prime does not.  Therefore (a) although the arguments that there are only three generations of quarks are indeed correct (and in fact do NOT allow for very massive generations), it happens that (b) the top-prime is not affected by the arguments in (a).]]></description>

The paper by Luty and Okui, together with the last reference is exactly what I was looking for. Need a bit time to diggest it though, but I’ll try to navigate by myself. Somewhat embarassed to missed the Rattazzi, Rychkov and Vichi paper, they indeed were in the slides. As for the argument, I should say I find it a “numerological” one by the gravity folks based on a intriguing coincidence. Basically they argue that every fermion from the SM obeys the inequality for naked singularities and not by the Kerr-Newman black holes, and then postulate a connection between elementary particles and naked singularities. It’s in the conclusions from [arXiv:0905.1077[gr-qc]] by George Matsas et al, if you would like to take a look. Just to be clear, I was not convinced, just intrigued. Anyway, thanks for the references]]></description>
