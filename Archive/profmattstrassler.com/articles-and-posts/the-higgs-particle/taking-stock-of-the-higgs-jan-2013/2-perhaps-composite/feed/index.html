					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/2-perhaps-composite/#comment-41371&quot;&gt;ohwilleke&lt;/a&gt;.

If you really mean &lt;strong&gt;linear&lt;/strong&gt; combination, the answer is no.  

A linear combination of spin-1 particles has spin-1.  [If I consider A = C + D, then A inherits the quantum numbers shared by C and D.] In fact the spin-1 photon and Z particles are linear combinations of the spin-1 W0 particle and B0 particle (or X0 in some notations).  The same is true of all the spin-0 mesons, which are linear combinations of other spin-0 mesons.

Furthermore, the mass of a linear combination of W&#039;s, Z and photon would be ill-defined, because the W&#039;s, Z and photon have definite but different masses, so the linear combination would &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have a definite mass.  Your formula (2m_W + m_Z)/Sqrt[4] would not apply to such a state.  The Z has a definite mass and is a linear combination of the W0 and B0 (or X0), but neither the W0 nor the B0 has a definite mass.

Similarly, a linear combination of something with charge +1 and something with charge -1 is something with no defined charge at all, not something with charge 0.

The fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same space is irrelevant in a linear combination of particles; since the combination is linear, there is only one boson at a time.

I&#039;m afraid that what&#039;s happening here is that you&#039;re trying to make a linear combination of apples and oranges.  This is not the way quantum mechanics works.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Would a Higgs boson that was a linear combination of the four electroweak bosons be considered composite and is the notion of the Higgs boson as a linear combination of the four electroweak bosons one the makes sense?

Let me explain:

* In electroweak theory, one speaks of the W+, W-, Z and photon as being linear combinations at a particular mixing angle with &quot;more fundamental&quot; bosons.  To quote wikipedia on the subject, &quot;The corresponding gauge bosons are the three W bosons of weak isospin from SU(2) (W+, W0, and W−), and the B0 boson of weak hypercharge from U(1), respectively, all of which are massless.  In the Standard Model, the W± and Z0 bosons, and the photon, are produced by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electroweak symmetry from SU(2) × U(1)Y to U(1)em, caused by the Higgs mechanism (see also Higgs boson). U(1)Y and U(1)em are different copies of U(1); the generator of U(1)em is given by Q = Y/2 + I3, where Y is the generator of U(1)Y (called the weak hypercharge), and I3 is one of the SU(2) generators (a component of weak isospin).The spontaneous symmetry breaking causes the W0 and B0 bosons to coalesce together into two different bosons – the Z0 boson, and the photon (γ)&quot; according to a matrix based on the weak mixing angle.

*  There are also several mesons that are described as linear combinations of other mesons (.e.g the neutral pion, the eta meson, the eta prime meson, the K-short meson, the K-long meson, the neutral rho meson, and the Omega meson).

*The Higgs boson mass is very close, to the limit of experimental accuracy to one H mass=(one W+ mass, plus one W- mass, plus one Z mass plus one photon mass)/sqrt(4).  
* The four electroweak bosons have a total charge of zero, just as the Higgs boson does.  
* The sum of their four spin-1&#039;s, added on a +/- basis as their are in mesons and hadrons, could produce a total spin of zero, observed in the Higgs bosons (one might expect a W+ and W- pair of opposite spin for these purposes, and a Z and a photon of opposite spin for these purposes).
* When mesons form linear combinations, the whole is expressed as the sum of the components that go into the linear combination divided by the square root of the number of linear combination components (usually two or three).  
* Of course, multiple bosons, essentially by definition and unlike fermions, can occupy the same space at the same time.

* It seems, however, that even if a Higgs boson was a linear combination of the four electroweak bosons would still be considered &quot;fundamental&quot; rather than &quot;composite&quot; in the sense of the discussion of this post, just as the four electroweak bosons are considered fundamental despite a derivation of a linear combination of massless W+. W-. W0 and B0 bosons via the Higgs mechanism.]]></description>
