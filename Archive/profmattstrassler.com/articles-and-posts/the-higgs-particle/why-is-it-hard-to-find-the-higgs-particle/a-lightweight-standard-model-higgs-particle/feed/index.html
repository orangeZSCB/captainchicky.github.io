					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-is-it-hard-to-find-the-higgs-particle/a-lightweight-standard-model-higgs-particle/#comment-2997&quot;&gt;Thomas Barton, JD&lt;/a&gt;.

It is possible for bumps to occur due to subtle effects, although the detectors are probably not going to cause it because of the way the invariant mass of two photons is constructed.  However, it could happen if there are multiple backgrounds that have to be added together, and the sum of their shapes puts a wiggle in the curve.  However, it is easy to get to 4 or 5 sigma.   Just quadruple your data.  Do that by doubling the data of each detector (ATLAS and CMS) and then combine what the two detectors say.  It will happen, we just have to be a little patient.]]></description>
