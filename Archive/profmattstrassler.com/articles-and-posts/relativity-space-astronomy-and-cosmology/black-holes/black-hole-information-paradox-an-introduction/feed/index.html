					<description><![CDATA[How can information be preserved in quantum physics?  You could only tell the past from information about particles if you could know that information (position and momentum etc) to an arbitrarily high precision.  But doesn&#039;t quantum physics say that you can&#039;t know that information to an arbitrarily high precision, even in principle?]]></description>
