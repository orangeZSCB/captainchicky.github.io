					<description><![CDATA[As redshift found its way into this thread I‚Äôm going to take the opportunity to ask some na√Øve questions.

I am stationary, relative to the Earth. A photon is approaching me at ‚Äúc‚Äù, and at the start of the scenario is one light minute away. 

I accelerate away from the photon at an appreciable % of ‚Äúc‚Äù. 
The photon is still closing the distance between us at ‚Äúc‚Äù, but it is redshifted. That means that when it catches up with me I will measure a red-shift. 

Does the photon have less energy as a result of being redshifted?
How could my action take energy from a photon that was up to one light minute away?
Is it only my measurement of the energy of the photon that is different?    
Is it equivalent to a situation in which if I am in a car travelling at 20mph and am hit from behind by a car travelling at 30mph, it hits me with less energy than if I had been stationary, but I didn‚Äôt actually take any energy from the second car by driving my own?     

Am I rambling?  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, I was fascinated by your comments about whether or not photons &quot;experience&quot; time/distance.

My understanding of this was:
Taking the time dilation equation to its ultimate conclusion may seem a logical thing to do, but it is not supported by special relativity because of the lack of mass of the photon which puts it outside the remit of special relativity. It seems that the best we can say is that we have no way of knowing if photons experience time, or not. Nor do we have any scientifically accredited theory that covers this, nor any way to test the idea experimentally, as no massive object can reach the speed of light, and a clock cannot be fixed to a photon. 

I&#039;ve never really been happy with this, but have yet to find a satisfactory counter.]]></description>

I&#039;m really impressed that senior researchers do have mistakes with reference frames, just like I did in high school. Here is another example, in which people even file a patent on wrong calculation due to using reference frames improperly:

That speedometer would reject the principle of relativity if it really worked.]]></description>

Wow, a fundamental mistake: wrong usage of reference frames. When you say &quot;If instead the source moves toward the stationary detector (at the same speed), a Doppler shift is only observed after a time delay which can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the initial distance between the source and the detector&quot;, you do imply that the source has not been moved toward before. Thus, the two reference frames you choose are no longer &quot;inertial&quot; to apply special relativity. You must use general relativity here to analyze the whole process (over a period of time you choose).]]></description>
