					<description><![CDATA[We don&#039;t know what is about 90% of the energy (dark energy) of the Universe. The same for about 90 % of matter (dark matter). We don&#039;t know if expansion ended, or why, and the same goes for expansion&#039;s beginning, of which we know &quot;nothing&quot;. The same should go for hyper-inflation. And so on. Isn&#039;t it extremely premature to state a theory? Is it reasonable? How does a theory with so many amendments survive? I never comprehended the attraction of the Big Bang Theory, save for religions reasons and purposes (read Genesis).]]></description>

Hello Matus,

The expression &quot;For all we know&quot; actually means we don&#039;t know. It&#039;s an English (perhaps American-English) idiom that may be confusing. I believe that what he is saying is that we don&#039;t know and is highlighting an &quot;extreme&quot; possibility as an example of how unconstrained our ignorance is.]]></description>
