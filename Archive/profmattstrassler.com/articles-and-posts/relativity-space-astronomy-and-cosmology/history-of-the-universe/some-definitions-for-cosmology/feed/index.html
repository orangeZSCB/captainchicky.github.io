I think that when discussing non-scientific opinions, you are free to believe or think what you would like.  But the theory of gravitational waves comes with very specific equations that make very specific predictions as to how they behave.  In those equations, it is impossible for gravitational waves in one universe to affect another universe.  For the purposes of a scientific conversation, any changes such as the ones you are suggesting would have to be first put into new, modified equations, and from there into predictions, and then tested observationally.  There would be many potential conceptual problems with such an idea, so it might be that there is no consistent mathematics that would allow this to occur without running into conflict with existing observations of the universe around us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[professor , i have been told in the temple that it is written in the ancient indian texts(VEDAS) that GOD says &quot; I BREATHE IN AND BREATHE OUT ALL THE UNIVERSES &quot;(in sanskrit universe is called as BRAHMAANDA) , hearing this i thought  about the multiverse concept . So what i think might be possible is that gravitational waves might not only ripple inwards of the universe but may also travel outside of the universe ( SPEAKING OF HIGHER DIMENSIONS WOULD BE NEXT POINT BUT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT.). just like bubble expanding when air is blown into it , this expansion may create disturbances both outside &#038; inside of the bubble . Now let us consider 2 or more bubbles expanding simultaneously in the same space near by , the expansion of each bubble may create disturbances in the space surrounding , the disturbance rippling outward of one bubble may produce disturbances inside some other bubble existing in the same space near by . so by using this example (not a perfect one) we can think that gravitational disturbances produced during the formation of other universes may also produce disturbances inside some other universe existing in the same &quot; SUPER SPACE&quot;(i mean to say the space common to all universes.) .
here i considered that existence of many universes were to be true even if there no direct scientific evidence.
so what do you think about this professor?]]></description>

No.  Energy is energy -- there can be many sources of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Professor, are you implying that the dark energy in the universe today, which is driving the increasing expansion, is connected to the energy that drove the inflation period of the very early universe ?]]></description>
