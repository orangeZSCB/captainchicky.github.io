					<description><![CDATA[Hi superb blog! Does running a blog similar to this require a lot of work?
I&#039;ve no expertise in computer programming however I was hoping 
to start my own blog soon. Anyhow, should you have any ideas or 
techniques for new blog owners please share. I know this is off 
topic but I simply had to ask. Thanks a lot!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Prof Strassler, thank you for the succinct explainations here. Please the explain the source(s) of light in this statement &#039; The light which then became free to travel across the universe provides us with the “cosmic microwave background&quot; &#039;. What exactly does background mean, background of what? is it that if we travel 13billion light years we&#039;ll be able to see it?

Thank You.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Prof,

Agreed with GEN. Great blog and superb website. After a rapid period of personal &quot;inflation&quot; I am suddenly a big fan, at least as much as an interested lay-person might be. Now some questions from a 20th century man trying to drag himself into the 21st century cosmology...

Having gained my entire formal education in physics during the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s, I was more or less led to believe that due to the explosive &quot;big bang&quot; (as it was then hypothesized) all matter created during or after that event was put in motion both cosmically and sub-atomically. Can motion in the cosmic sense still be thought of as a necessary property of matter after discounting the apparent relative motion imparted by inflation? I&#039;d like to emphasize &quot;necessary&quot; . In other words, must all matter have an absolute large-scale motion as well as a relative one in an expanding universe? 

Thanks.  JG]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Strassler, first of all, thank you for the wonderful blog.  It&#039;s one of the few that I read regularly.  Being a non-physicist, I have a few naive questions.  First, how long did the transition from inflationary to hot big bang take?  Was this instantaneous everywhere, or more like the formation of crystals in solution?  Second, how does the presence of dark energy transform to heat?  And finally, what determined how much dark energy was left over after its transformation to heat (i.e., what determined how much dark energy is still present in the universe, or at least our observable patch?)

Again, many thanks for the wonderful blog!

Cheers,
Phil]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s right (thanks a lot for the correction!):

Cations are ions that flow to the cathode (the rod in a battery that has negative electric charge), so, they are positively charged ions.

Ions produced by pure energy ionization are basically cations, as an influx of enough energy will free electrons from the outer layers of orbitals, the atoms will no longer be electrically neutral, as they lose some negative electric charge, they will become positively charged.

Ions can be formed by other processes different from pure energy ionization, and these other processes are relevant to chemistry but not to the focus of our discussion.

I use the term &quot;pure energy ionization&quot; to differentiate it from other kinds of ion formation.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>
