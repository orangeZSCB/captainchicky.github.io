					<description><![CDATA[These are the kinds of articles that break language. When &quot;space expanding&quot; is stated in graphic language or text language, the very idea of &quot;expansion&quot; leads to the very real question: into what?  Then that leads to &quot;how can the universe be infinite if it is expanding into something&quot;.  Of course, the answer, in language, is that it cannot be infinite because it is expanding which means it must be &quot;growing&quot; into something that is not-space-time.  So then the question becomes, &quot;What is the not-space-time into which space-time is expanding.&quot;  And if there is no not-space-time, how can space-time expand?

And then you get brain burn.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is where absolute acceptance of the Word of The Lord (Jesus) is essential. There was never a BB starting explosion, but a carefully crafted universe over a 6 of 24 hour day period, that obeys His maths laws and geometry, and science will eventually have to accept that. That is why it&#039;s possible calculate Hubble&#039;s Constant to its absolute accuracy of 70.98047 using The &#039;Principle of Astrogeometry&#039;  (Kindle Books). The Hubble equation is  2 X a megaparsec X C, divided by Pi to the power of 21. A Parsec is 3.26 light years, and C is in kilometres per second. To obtain the Imperial Hubble value, simply input miles per second to C, and the Imperial Hubble value is around 42 miles per sec per megaparsec. A maths / space Professor at Imperial College, London verified, and accepted the Astrogeometry Hubble &#039;fixing&#039; equation, describing it as &#039;elegant&#039;. The reciprocal of 70.98047 is 13.778 billion light years, and as that value is fixed, and never increases as time passes, stating it&#039;s not the age of the universe, but the Hubble Horizon Distance only, David Hine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is now a very simple way to calculate Hubble’s Constant, by inputting to an equation, the numerical value of Pi and the speed of light (C) from Maxwell’s equations, and the value of a parsec. NO space probe measurements (with their inevitable small measuring / interpretation errors) are now required. Hubble’s Constant is ‘fixed’ at 70.98047 PRECISELY. This maths method removes the errors / tolerances that is always a part of attempting to measuring something as ‘elusive’ as Hubble’s Constant. This has very deep implications for theoretical cosmology.
The equation to perform this is 2 X a meg parsec X light speed (C). This total is then divided by Pi to the power of 21. This gives 70.98047 kilometres per sec per meg parsec.
The equation to perform this can also be found in ‘The Principle of Astrogeometry’ on Amazon Kindle Books. This also explains how the Hubble 70.98047 ‘fixing’ equation was found. David.]]></description>
