					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Big Bangul nu a fost o explozie, ci o expansiune a spațiului. Adică o bucată de spațiu de mărimea monitorului pe care citiți aceste rînduri a crescut, într-o cîtime de secundă, pînă la mărimea universului vizibil din zilele noastre. Pentru niște detalii foarte mișto, las aici un link către o pagină în engleză: Inflation. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice description and great diagrams. Can I use them in my public outreach lectures please? I will credit you on the slides (&quot;Diagrams courtesy Matt Strassler&quot; is my usual wording style). 
I also look forward to reading more of your articles when I find time. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also: although the Schwartzchild radius of the observable universe is smaller than the universe is now, it would have been larger than the observable universe at some point in its early stages.. In a non accelerating space time, a quantum fluctuation as large as the universe would have just become a black hole surely?

So, could this hyper fast expansion of space time be the process by which such amassive quantum fluctuation  - which at some level far below the energy of the Big Bang must create an event horizon - could have &quot;evaporated&quot; (?!) the event horizon enough to allow the energy to then produce the Big Bang?

Could black holes then be a mechanism to conserve symmetry?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If our universe&#039;s space time is expanding, it will get colder and colder through time, as it&#039;s doing.
However, if the expansion of space time is accelerating, will there be a slow but progressive increase in the amount of Unruh radiation being produced?
Given that the Universe is likely flat and this process could go on for ever, could this Unruh temperature then create the necessary starting conditions for the Big Bang?]]></description>
