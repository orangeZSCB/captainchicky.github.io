You are correct, this effect was not taken into account at the time.  Current models suggest that this is a small effect that shouldn&#039;t affect present conclusions to a great extent. (An estimated 2% variance in brightness.)  More tricky is &#039;asymmetry&#039;; that is 1A supernovae do not &#039;ignite&#039; at the dead center of the core, something that affects both their outputs and apparent brightness by as much as 20 percent.

Greater numbers of observations should remove the wide scatter due to asymmetry at which point the metallicity question will need to be addressed. Should the data resolve into something that does not support dark energy then the metallicity explanation will be by itself insufficient. It&#039;s not at all expected that will be the case, but then again that&#039;s what we say about dark energy.]]></description>

I have one question regarding this explanation, which depends on the 1A being a standard candle. Suppose it is not? For example, see Wang et al., Science, 340; 170 (2013), where two classes of 1As were found, one of which is only found in more recent galaxies, and the luminosity depends on metallicity. What we see is actually the outer envelope in our line, and that should largely comprise material deposited on the star just prior to the explosion, i.e. material from the companion star. The greater the metallicity, the greater the visible emissions, and irrespective of what goes on inside the explosion, you would expect that light to be absorbed before it was emitted. If so, the older 1As would be expected to be dimmer for the red shift, which is what is observed. This is presumably an effect that was not allowed for in the original calculations (either that or the peer reviewers of Science were asleep at the wheel) and this effect could well allow for the discrepancies we observe, especially given the wide scatter in the data.]]></description>

There are two things to note; first of all when we plot the expansion rate of the universe we see, it is not a straight line OR a decreasing curve. Instead it initially decreases but then is starts to increase again. (See for example the first graph here: http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2012-news/Schneider11-2012 )

Secondly what is being measured to get these results are &#039;standard candles&#039;; exploding stars. The brightness of a number of supernovae are measured and plotted against their redshift.

As they are known to (pretty much) be the same *actual* brightness, apparent brightness thus tells us how far away they are. (Twice as far is four times as dim.) The redshift gives us the amount of expansion that has happened between the light&#039;s emission and now. (If the universe doubled in size the spectrum&#039;s wavelength is also doubled.) 

What was expected was that if one star was twice as close to Earth as another it would have *less* than half the redshift since its light would have traveled here during the &#039;slower half&#039; of that expansion. Steady expansion would have made that *exactly* half the redshift. What was found was that in the early universe yes, this was the case, but more recent supernovae are more redshifted than expected meaning that the expansion must be increasing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Professor Strassler,
I have a lingering doubt on the theory that the expansion of our universe is accelerating and hope that you can help clear my thought. The main reason of my doubt is that the ages of the observed objects are different. Although it has been proven that the more distant objects move at a faster speed away from us, it has taken the light longer time for these objects to be seen by us, therefore these objects as we see today have different ages (from the Big Bang). If we use the best available Hubble&#039;s constant of 70.4 km/sec/Mpc (229.5 km/sec/Mly), then the most distant object 13.8 Gly away that we are seeing today has a speed of 298,012 km/s. The object is in its state of infancy, approximately 13.8Gy ago, soon after the Big Bang. If the object is 10 Gly away, its speed is 215,951 km/sec, and the object is approximately 3.8 Gy old. 

If we plot the recession speeds of the objects against their distances from us, we have a linearly increasing line. However, if we plot the recession speeds of the objects against their ages after the Big Bang, we have a linearly decreasing line. This tells me that as an object ages, its speed decreases. If we observe the same distance object some years later, we should see its speed lower than today&#039;s. This is on contradiction to the theory that the universe is expanding at an ever faster pace. I&#039;d appreciate your thought on this. Thank you in advance and thank you for all your articles.]]></description>
