Thanks! However, I see plenty of references to &quot;the beginning of the universe.&quot; Of course, some religious people love it. But, I can&#039;t reconcile an evolving universe and a universe without beginning or end.
BTW, I&#039;m reading &quot;And There Was Light: The Discovery of the Universe&quot; by Thiel 1957. I won&#039;t find an answer there, but it&#039;s a fascinating read anyway.]]></description>

Mel, this is a bit late, but perhaps it will help new readers (or you might be notified :)).

The name doesn’t mean anything! It was invented by a guy arguing *against* the Big Bang theory – in this case, by Hoyle – the steady-state guy – himself. Some say it was meant as ridicule, but Hoyle explicitly denied it. It was just a cool name, and it stuck. This is not exactly rare in science – Schrödinger’s Cat (Schrödinger was pointing out how weird conclusions the then-interpretation of quantum physics allowed), Butterfly Effect (“So you’re basically saying a butterfly flapping its wings could cause hurricanes?”)… The theory dates to about 1931 – the name was coined in 1949, in a radio programme with Hoyle.

But regardless, intuitions aren’t necessarily a good guide when you get far from our ancestral environment. Plenty of people still find it counter-intuitive that light can behave like a wave despite having no medium to propagate in. Or that there’s no one absolute clock that measures time in the universe. Or that (assuming relativity is correct enough) FTL travel inherently implies time travel/breech of causality etc.. Just because you call something a “bang” doesn’t mean it’s going to behave the way other bangs you see around you behave. And if there ever *was* a beginning of space and time, it would make little sense to talk about what was before – “before” wouldn’t even make sense; but “bang” would still be a decent name, since everything (especially time) “exploded” away from that event. Assuming time is a separate entity in the first place (e.g. Barbour’s timeless universe).]]></description>

&quot;once science starts to give its Myth of Origins , then it is not science any more ….. Any single word about what was BEFORE the HBB as shown in the history of the universe illustration of Matt. IS mere unscientificnonsense.&quot;
I must strongly disagree. It is scientific practice to hypothesize. It is testing by experiment that prevents science from becoming unsubstantiated dogma.]]></description>
