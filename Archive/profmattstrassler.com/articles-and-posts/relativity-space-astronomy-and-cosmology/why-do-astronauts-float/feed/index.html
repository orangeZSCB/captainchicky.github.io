Are you an idiot? You can only do weightlessness on the vomit comet 30 seconds at a time. How is that a replacement for the ISS. By the way, the ISS is international, not just NASA. That&#039;s why the first word in ISS is International! Wow you are ignorant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s one flaw in this article. It erroneously says that the shape of the earth is relevant to orbital mechanics. It says that because the earth curve underneath the orbiting body that&#039;s why the orbiting body keeps the same distance from he surface of the earth. That&#039;s completely wrong. As far as the orbiting body is concerned all the earth&#039;s mass is concentrated at its center of gravity. The shape of the body being orbited is completely irrelevant. Ask yourself, when an asteroid is being orbited does the orbiting body follow the irregular shape of the asteroid? Of course not. That&#039;s nonsense. The shape of the body being orbited has NOTHING to do with orbital mechanics. In fact, most orbits are elliptical and DO NOT keep the same distance from the earth!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The international space station is useless because all test performed there can be done in a zero g airplane and cost many millions of dollars less. 

But it makes sense when you realize that  NASA is filling our heads with lies while at the same time filling their pockets with taxpayer money. It cost $5000 to take a ride on the Zero G vomit comet. NASA has spent 100 billion dollars on the fake space station in 10 years and it cost 81 million dollars to send a person to it. Anyone can see what&#039;s going on here and it makes sense why NASA needs this to  keep up this scherade.  I&#039;ll admit I would trick all you fools for that kind of money too so I understand the deception.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Zero G NASA Airplane (is) the space station people come on. When did everybody become so gullible. Notice how the international space station is the exact shape and size of the hull of an Airplane. If we were to actually make a space station wich we have (not) then is would be much larger than the hull of an Airplane. It would be very large with multiple rooms and hallways and corridors. Not to mention that the space station is virtually void of Windows. If I were to build a space station I would have a 10 foot by 10 foot viewing window. Seems strange not to out windows everywhere. Were fully capeable of making a window that can with stand the pressure of space. But this is all irrelevant because humans have never been that far up from the Earth surface. Good day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, objects of different masses fall at different speeds. Because everything that has mass has gravity.

At small sizes, the difference is so small that we can neglect it, although precision instruments can measure it.

But at large sizes (let&#039;s say, the size of a moon) the difference would be noticeable... you would have the Earth pulling the object, but the object would also pull on the Earth with considerable gravity and the speed would add.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, just became aware of your blog through Google, and found that 
it&#039;s really informative. I am gonna watch out for brussels.

I&#039;ll bbe grateful if you continue this in future.
Lots of people will be benefited from your writing.

Cheers!]]></description>
