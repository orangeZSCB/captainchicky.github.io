What we observe is an expansion of space, not of matter into pre-existing space. As for infinities, such exist only in arbitrary mathematical definitions of number sets . You can have lines stretching into infinity, made of dimensionless points, but there is no corresponding physical reality to such inventions of the human mind. The physical universe is of necessity finite, though very large indeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/big-bang-classic-confusions/#comment-4310&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

This doesn’t make sense. It is self-contradictory for something infinite to get bigger or expand. If something is infinite spatially, then it takes up all possible space. Hence, there is no space to expand into because if there were an infinite thing would already occupy it. Infinite things cannot grow. If they did, then it would be proof that they had not been infinite in the first place. Now, finite things could be placed in something infinite, and they can move, expand, etc.

You cannot double infinity. In your illustration, (if I understand it) you have a number line going on into infinity, and yet you double them? What are you doubling? Sure, you can use the individual numbers to perform math problems, but you’re not increasing or expanding the infinite number set. You can place commas in between the individual numbers in the infinite number set, but the number set is infinite in value not in space. You can break down any of the numbers into fractions, but that doesn’t increase or expand the infinite value. Additionally, counting numbers can go on infinity, but they are not infinite in nature because infinity is boundless and immeasurable by definition and a beginning is a boundary and measurement. Pi isn’t infinite in nature, but it can go on infinity in description.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always found it curious that serious scientists explaining expansion of 3D object with rules for 2D object. As a joke I can imagine clerics using zero dimension object to explain space expansion - in 0D world everything can happen, no rules at all :-)
 The same approach is used to explain why there is no center of expansion - &quot;imagine you are on the surface of the baloon, and surface of the baloon is expanding and you being on the surface can&#039;t tell where is the center of expansion...&quot;. Wrong analogy. Our space is 3D as we know it (or even more dimensional). So if you use baloon analogy then your baloon should also be a 3D object, and each expanding 3D ballon naturally has center point. Because it expands outwards from some initial point. If you object using analogy of 3D space with 3D baloon then explain why do you object. 
Same troubles I have comprehending Einstein gravity demonstration as analogy with some net bulged down. And rolling ball move along the bulge. But in real world it is not bulged down. it is bulged in all directions and all angles and even to front of the moving object. The same flawed analogy is used for depicting black holes - a funnel directed downwards. But in reality that funnel is directed to inner center point thus it is not a funnel at all.
Analogy is good when it is relevant and not misleading.
Still, frankly, as a layman, I am suspisious that common explanation that speed of light is not violated by inflation because it is space expansion - I am suspicious it is kind of a trick to get rid of the major model flaw.]]></description>
