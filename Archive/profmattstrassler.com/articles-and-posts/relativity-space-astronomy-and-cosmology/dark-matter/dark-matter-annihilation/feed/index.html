I suppose my question simply is this conjecture have any basis of validity from a hypothetical standpoint given what is already known, or are there obvious flaws that, as a layperson, I may have missed due to a lack of understanding or ignorance?

Thank you.

					<description><![CDATA[Professor Strassler,

I have a rather naive question that has been bothering me for several days.  I was hoping if someone could enlighten me.  To me, it seems rather natural to conceive the notion that dark matter is an exotic form of matter transformed from ordinary matter in black holes which sends it into other spacial dimensions that do not interact with our own.  It also seems natural that gravity may be the only force capable of interacting with mass across multidimensional boundries and why it influences the formation/structure of galaxies like our own.  This may also explain why detection is extremely difficult.  During the early universe, very little dark matter would have existed then and why only eliptical galaxies would have formed.  Of course, this is only a layman&#039;s conjecture but it seems rational to me.  

Thank you for your time sir.

					<description><![CDATA[To be clear:
22 -&#062; represents a thing with mass feeling a pull from another thing that has mass.
12 -&#062; represents a thing with charge whose EM field somehow interacts with the Gravitational field of another thing to cause a push or a pull.

It would be really interesting if these kinds of interactions could occur.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish you well.  I find it surprising that plots like figure 4 haven&#039;t already been generated from pointing a telescope towards the center of the galaxy... it&#039;s such a big target, and close too.  Admittedly, the idea of the existence of dark matter has never really sat well with me; I understand that astrophysicists don&#039;t really understand the mechanism for the accelerating expansion of the universe and came up with the idea of dark matter as a fudge factor.  Under your assumption that dark matter can self annihilate, if you can find a little bump in the photon energies, well, I would be little less skeptical about the whole thing (not that my skepticism really has any bearing on the astrophysical community at all).

Here is another idea in particle physics that has gnawed at me... in production reactions where photons combine to form matter, antimatter is always generated as a product as well.  So, at the beginning, during the big bang if all of the matter in the universe was generated from photon reactions, then there should be a lot of antimatter floating around somewhere as well.  If I understand correctly, we don&#039;t detect of the correct energy signature for gamma radiation that should be spiking all over the place if antimatter were to react with matter somewhere within our light radius.  So, assuming that antimatter was generated during the big bang, is it possible that most or almost all of it is outside of the light radius?

Does antimatter have the same gravitational pull inwards that matter does?  Does that gravitational pull become a push when reacting with matter&#039;s gravitational field?  Is it only charge that gets reversed between matter and antimatter?  What is the mechanism that causes matter and antimatter to annihilate, anyways?  Why do they do that --- annihilate, I mean?  Are there cross-force reactions that can occur in nature --- like the weak force interacting with the electromagnetic force, is this possible?

1 - Electro-Magnetic force carriers
2 - Gravitational force carriers
3 - Weak nuclear force carriers
4 - Strong nuclear force carriers

We have lots of physics and equations to describe interactions like 11, 22, 33, 44... but do weird interactions like: 12, 13, 14, ever occur?  Do interactions between groups of 3 fundamental forces at a time ever occur like:  123, 124, etc?  If they did, I suppose they would be pretty difficult to isolate, wouldn&#039;t they?  

Goodnight Dr. Strassler]]></description>

You should view this as a little hint of something.  The line might not be there at all; it is just on the borderline of detectability.  Even if it is there, it may be due to some unknown atomic effect and have nothing to do with dark matter at all.  Moreover, even if it were dark matter, it might have nothing to do with sterile neutrinos.  There&#039;s a long, long way to go.  https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/18/x-rays-from-dark-matter-a-little-hint-for-you-to-enjoy/]]></description>
