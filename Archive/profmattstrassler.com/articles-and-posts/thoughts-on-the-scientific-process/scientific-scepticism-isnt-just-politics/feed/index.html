					<description><![CDATA[To anyone who doesn&#039;t know and is reading this:
Historically he OPERA superluminal neutrino fiasco was a complete embarrassment trace to a simple synchronization error.

Neutrinos do not travel faster than light.  Moreover, the fact that the 1987 supernova event produced equal numbers of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and they arrived on Earth at pretty much the same time as the light from the supernova tells us, to a high degree of certainty that:

1) neutrinos and anti-neutrinos travel at the speed of light, and

2) anti-neutrinos are likely bent by gravitational lensing in exactly the same manner that neutrinos are, which is to say that they bend around any intervening gravitating bodies and dark matter in the same direction as neutrinos.  In other words, it is unlikely that bulk anti-matter would exhibit anything like &#039;anti-gravity&#039;.   This discovery meant, among other things, that a corroborating antimatter gravity interaction experiment was a low priority for the LHC, so it has been delayed indefinitely in favor of the higher energy upgrades and follow-up to the Higgs discovery.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This discussion is interesting and informative. Based on your point that each element of the argument should have one or more experiments confirming, I find that we need to change our little paper accordingly.   You made me realize that what I found is in fact a confirmation by experimentation of one certain aspect of OPERA Superluminosity while other experiments concerning neutrino&#039;s themselves confirm further properties necessary.

Thanks much!]]></description>
