					<description><![CDATA[First off I would like to say excellent blog! I had 
a quick question in which I&#039;d like to ask if you don&#039;t mind.

I was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear your thoughts before writing.

I&#039;ve had a tough time clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out.
I do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 
to 15 minutes tend to be wasted just trying to figure out 
how to begin. Any ideas or hints? Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With havin so much content and articles do you ever run into any 
problems of plagorism or copyright infringement? My website has a 
lot of unique content I&#039;ve either authored myself or outsourced 
but it seems a lot of it is popping it up all over the internet without my 
authorization. Do you know any solutions to help prevent content from being ripped off?
I&#039;d genuinely appreciate it.]]></description>
