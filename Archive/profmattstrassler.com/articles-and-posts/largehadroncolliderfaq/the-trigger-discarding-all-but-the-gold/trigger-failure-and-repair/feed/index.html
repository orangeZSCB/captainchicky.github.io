					<description><![CDATA[Dear Matt, glad to see you back to your blog. 

1. Have you received any feedback from ATLAS or CMS about the realization of the suggested modifications on triggering system for Run2 ?
2. Any progress made with the parked data analysis about the possible long living particles ? 

I&#039;m looking forward to read your comments during the upcoming results from Run2.

Thank you for your efforts.]]></description>

In case you happen to see this, I check this periodically and am patiently waiting for a reply. :)

I&#039;ve been wondering this since long ago when you started mentioning you would be writing a triggering article, and I should have asked then so it got included here. Oh well!]]></description>

&lt;b&gt;Dino:&lt;/b&gt; all points noted. The problem is that if scientific progress doesn&#039;t come from HEP, it will look like particle physicists have been standing in the way of scientific progress for decades telling fairy tales. There&#039;s critical books out there, and funding pressures. Without scientific progress from HEP there will be big problems for HEP that IMHO will cause problems for physics and science at large.]]></description>

John,

I get the impression that you have a gut feeling of what you think the truth is regarding certain phenomena. But I also get the impression that you feel you lack the ability to get at these things yourself. Perhaps mathematical challenges? If so you are certainly not alone – even Einstein wished he knew more math…

I guess what I’m trying to figure out is if there is, as you say, “low hanging fruit out there” why not reach for some yourself?

Regardless, you will never convince anyone to pursue “Dirac belts”, “bag model universes” or “gravity as a trace em force” just because you may like these ideas. There are a lot of ideas out there, and you must realize that various ideas have different appeal to different people. So while you may be taken with certain ideas you cannot expect anyone else to be taken by the same ones that you are. If you think otherwise then IMHO you are banging your head against the wall.]]></description>

Michael: I&#039;ve read it. See where it says &lt;I&gt;&quot;A virtual particle is not a particle at all.&quot;&lt;/I&gt; The gluons in a proton are virtual. As in &lt;I&gt;not real.
