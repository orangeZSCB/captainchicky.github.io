					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt.

Very clear and interesting post as always.

Maybe all the computing problem presented here will dramatically change when the quantum computing will be mature enough to be used at LHC (or what we will use after its &quot;dead&quot;). 
I looked for links to see if something like this is already in developing for LHC but I did found nothing. Do you know if such projects exists at LHC?
I could found only several interesting articles like this one (it worth an eye):

Thank you for all you are building here.]]></description>
