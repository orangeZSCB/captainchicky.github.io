This is a SCIENCE site. You know, the science your Bronze Age superstition has fought against tooth and nail for the last millennia before being forced time after time to admit that the Earth is not flat and is not at the centre of the Universe, or is orbited by the Sun and so on.
Go peddle your fairy tales somewhere else.]]></description>

The energy is intrinsic to the proton, and comes mainly, as Matt explains, from the motion energy of the quarks and the binding energy of the strong force between quarks carried by gluons. It can’t run down because there’s nowhere to run: it is already at its lowest possible level for this type of bound system. The only way the energy can change is if there is more energy forced in from outside the system, e.g. from intense gravitational pressure inside a star, or by smashing another proton into it in the LHC. There are much better explanations throughout this website, so explore!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Colossians 1:16,17:  For by him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether they are kings, lords, rulers, or powers. All things have been created through him and for him.  He himself existed before anything else did, and he holds all things together. Bible - International Standard Version

Another translation states this text as, in him all things consist.  Yet another translation renders this text as, he holds all things together by the might of his power.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hiiii Professor!! Im a student and i have a question hoping that it will be answered. How would you compute for an atomic mass of an element if the number of protons is unknown?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Professor Strassler,

Can you recommend any reference books, undergraduate and graduate that actually provide accurate information on particle physics  and quantum physics. Most state that the proton is made of 3 quarks. I would like to learn to the be#t of my ability, but that requires correct reading material too. Any advice would be gratefully received.Thankyou.]]></description>
