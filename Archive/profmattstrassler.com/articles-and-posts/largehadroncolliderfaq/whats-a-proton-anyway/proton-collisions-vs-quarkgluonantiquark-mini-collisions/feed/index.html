					<description><![CDATA[I have designed a vortex accelerator that would achieve 40 % increased acceleration in an extremely short distance. It would be shorter than three meters and would allow the column to reduce frictional drag, thereby temporarily defying the effects of gravity. My patent is pending. It would be great to work with CERN on this project and I truly feel it could have a large impact on the world of physics. This is nothing like a Venturi  and it is nothing similiar to the vortex tube CERN utilized. Instead it truly is a new motion harnessed in my invention and through the aid of electronic pulse magnets I believe the collider could achieve energy levels  not previously possible. If you are interested, please contact me at your convenience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi!Only a few days back I became aware of your excellent blog. I am a retired physics prof. here.Can you give me a reference which calculates with what energy quarks or gluons collide for a given cm energy of the two protons. I suspect it is quite involved and depends in which direction they are moving at the instance of collision and for each event one has to reconstruct.Thanks. From now on I will read your blog carefully!
