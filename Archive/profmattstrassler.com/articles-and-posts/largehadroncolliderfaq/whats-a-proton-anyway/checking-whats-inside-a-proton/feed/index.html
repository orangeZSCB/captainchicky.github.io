A proton can indeed absorb a photon and enter a more energetic state. In fact this is a mechanism that slows high energy protons in cosmic rays, they &#039;bump into&#039; the cosmic microwave background photons, absorb them and become excited, later decaying. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greisen%E2%80%93Zatsepin%E2%80%93Kuzmin_limit]]></description>

I mean linear not lateral, the direction of photon wave propagation is linear kinetic energy and it is converted into angular kinetic energy when absorbed by an electron... just a conjecture :-)]]></description>

An electron could absorb a photon of specific wavelength which enable that electron to quantum jump energy level, maybe particles within the proton can do that too? Photon absorption somehow involved conversion of lateral kinetic energy of the photon into angular kinetic energy perhaps? Interesting to think about considering a photon is the least possible ball of ripples that an electric field could have while an electron (which absorbed that photon) is the least possible ball of ripples that an electron field could have. I surely like to know too how does it work :-)]]></description>

I expect photons not to be bound inside a proton because I cannot imagine what would bind them. They do not react to the strong force which is what binds quarks and gluons. They might be reabsorbed by charged particles, but what stops a photon being produced at the &#039;surface&#039; of the proton or by chance not interacting with charged particles long enough to escape the proton? Certainly the &#039;virtual photons&#039; produced by the proton are not confined which allows it to exert an electromagnetic force over a distance. I would be interested in any references that deal with the matter of photon confinement under these circumstances.]]></description>

There are two bits to the answer of why they don&#039;t annihilate to photons:

1. quark-antiquark annihilation happens through the strong interaction and therefore you get gluons.

2. But sometimes (they have opposite charges) they annihilate through the electromagnetic interaction and you do get photons.  But those photons are confined inside the proton too - why do you expect them not to be?

These photons don&#039;t last very long and the photon-photon annihilation of quark-antiquark is very rare (scale of the difference of the strengths of the strong and electromagnetic forces) compared to gluon-gluon.

Incidentally, you don&#039;t get anything else from a quark-antiquark collision inside a proton because of the energies - the total energy in the proton is just under a GeV, and all the other possible results (W, Z) of quark-antiquark collisions are higher energy than that.

You can get strange-antistrange quark pairs, but you need to go through a gluon-gluon pair to get there.]]></description>
