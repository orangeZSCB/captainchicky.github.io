					<description><![CDATA[We know electron by what it does, not by what it is. / by Israel Socratus /
====================
a) Planck and Einstein found the energy of electron as: E=h*f
b) Sommerfeld found the formula of an electron as : e^2=ah*c
c) Dirac found two (2) more formulas of electron’s energy: 
        +E=Mc^2 and -E=Mc^2
d) According to QED in interaction with vacuum electron’s 
energy is infinite: E= ∞ 
e) Electron tied with atom by the energy: E=-me^4/2h*^2= -13,6eV 
Nobody knows why electron has six ( 6 ) formulas and we don&#039;t know 
what  are  interactions between these formulas.
====..
Electron has six (6) formulas it means that the electron can be in
six different states and electron can come from one state to another.
To come from one state to another one must be some mechanism 
of changes. What is mechanism of its changes? Nobody gives answer.
=====. . 
Electron is not stable, solid, firm, steel  particle .
Electron&#039;s size, mass, energy   is dependent on its velocity.
Electron&#039;s size, mass, energy   is dependent  on its spin / angular momentum.
The angular momentum can be different:  1/2, 3/2,  5/2, 7/2   . . . .  etc.
When angular moment is stronger,  its size is smaller, the frequency is higher and 
the energy is bigger: E=h(bar)f.
=====..
a) The electron follows Fermi- Dirac  statistics.
b) The electron obeys Pauli Exclusion Law.
c) The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle / Law 
d) Electron takes important part in Maxwell&#039;s electrodynamics ( Lorentz force -
-  theory of electrons: F = qE + qv × B )
e) The electron must observe 
&#039;&#039; The Law of conservation and transformation of energy/ mass&#039;&#039;.
  Why does &#039;&#039; simple&#039;&#039; electron obey fife ( 5 ) Laws ? 
  ====.
Conclusion from some article: 
&#039;&#039;One of the best kept secrets of science is that 
physicists have lost their grip on reality.&#039;&#039;
===============. .
Today electron is an abstract, symbolic construction.  
  Mainstream physics doesn&#039;t know what electron is.
Book &quot; What is the Electron?&quot;, by  Volodimir Simulik  Montreal, Canada. 2005. /
In this book:
‘ More than ten different models of the electron are presented here. 
More than twenty models are discussed briefly. 
Thus, the book gives a complete picture of contemporary theoretical
thinking (traditional and new) about the physics of the electron.’
#
And In the internet is possible to find 100 different models of electron.
All of these models of  electron are problematical.
=====================.
 We know electron by what it does, not by what it is  and the orthodox style
 of thinking  wouldn&#039;t open the door to understand what electron is.
=================================. .
Best wishes.
Israel  Sadovnik  Socratus
