					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/what-are-anti-particles/#comment-293137&quot;&gt;debkalyan&lt;/a&gt;.

Kind of, except that there seems to be a very small bias towards matter, which is why the universe has any visible matter at all (it&#039;s been one of the big open questions in cosmology - if matter and antimatter were really created in equal amounts, there should be no matter or antimatter left!).

However, your examples are not a production of particle/anti-particle pairs. Photons are their own anti-particle - do not confuse protons and photons, they&#039;re very different beasts. A CRT doesn&#039;t _produce_ electrons either - it liberates them from atoms. The electrons were already there, and you just nudged them off. The same principle applies in static electricity - you&#039;re moving the electrons, not creating/destroying them.

When a proton changes into a neutron, you also get a positron and an electron neutrino. But you don&#039;t get an electron at the same time to &quot;balance out&quot; the positron - the charges are already balanced; for the electric charge, you started with a proton (+1), and ended up with a neutron (0), a neutrino (0) and a positron (+1).

What is usually meant when people say &quot;matter and anti-matter are produced at the same time&quot; is that when you smash e.g. two highly energetic photons together, you get an electron and a positron. But the symmetry comes from the conservation laws - two photons have zero electric charge, so any products that result from their interaction must also have zero electric charge. Thus, you can&#039;t smash two photons and get two electrons out - that would mean creating electric charge (among other things) out of nothing.]]></description>

Nu ska jag detinifivt kÃ¶pa den &#8211; nu Ã¤r jag fast. Den jag har frÃ¥n Dr Hauchka gav mig kli och irriration i Ã¶gonen (recension senare idag). SÃ¥g att Ã¤ven Tanja frÃ¥n Ekostil hade samma problem. SÃ¥ nu behÃ¶ver jag en ny mascara, och jag har varit sugen pÃ¥ denna ett tag. Tack.]]></description>
