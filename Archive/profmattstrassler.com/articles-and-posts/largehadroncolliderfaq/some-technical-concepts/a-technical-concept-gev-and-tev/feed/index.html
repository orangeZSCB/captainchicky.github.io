					<description><![CDATA[Hello Professor Strassler,

Last year&#039;s (September 23, 2020) experiment at ATLAS that produced W bosons by colliding two high-energy particles of light (photons) was astounding.  

From a layman&#039;s perspective, it is hard to understand the energies used to do the research work done at CERN.  A tremendous amount of energy was required to create matter from light.

Would you mind telling me how many Megawatts of energy are consumed daily on a data-taking day at CERN?  

I&#039;m trying to relate CERN&#039;s energy consumption to something more accessible for a layperson to understand.  That is: how many homes could be powered for a day, each day CERN is online?

Thanks in advance for shedding some light on this for us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re planning on writing this article in your own language, or English. I&#039;m guessing from the name that you might speak/write English as a second language, which is fine. I helped to teach those learning the language years ago. It takes awhile to get really good at it because English is one of the hardest languages in the world to learn. Good luck!]]></description>

I&#039;m assuming you want to write an article for your school magazine. Not sure what you&#039;re saying. I&#039;m a writer, and besides knowledge of your subject, having good English skills will help you get published. Learn as much as you can about what you want to write about, and also try and acquire the best English and grammar skills you can. Editors look at both when they decide who to publish. Good luck with your article.]]></description>

you can&#039;t prove a negative so what you are asking is impossible john. also if you look into particle decay rates, all irregular matter has incredibly small decay times(milliseconds or less). top quarks especially are ultra transient particles because they too massive to be a low energy state. Even if they made it to the core, the effects would be negligible as they are too few (i am pretty sure the thousands of feet of rock between the surface and the core would stop it first however).]]></description>

So Phillip because you make a statement &#039;because it is true&quot; and your in depth answer stating the atmosphere has been spun with the earth for all this time into sync. Why then can clouds travel at different speeds in different directions and differing heights. Surely the clouds would have only one direction available to travel, then if this was the case clouds would seem not too move if one looked at them. In case you struggle with an answer to part A; Try part B; How do planes flying east to west  ever reach their destination? The earths rotation easily outpaces any commercial jet by 400kms an hour so what is the secret there, please share.]]></description>
