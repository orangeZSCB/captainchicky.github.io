					<description><![CDATA[I love this article. Had to leave a comment to let you know your work is appreciated!
One question though. Would a theoretical fully isolated particle or elementary particle ever decay?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So in summary; the collider hurls a vibration or specific resonance at a target. The result of more propulsion shortening the time the soundwave/resonance exists and reducing its spray pattern. Speed alters the pitch, tone and measurable target area and uses. Particles/wavelength&#039;s? Which are we studying?]]></description>

Thank is for the reply. I was expecting no one to even see my comment. I am not a scientist too.
After reading the comment I had the same question you raised at the end.

I studied both quantum and classical field theory. Assuming large scale structure of space time to have point like locations, like crystal lattice structures, that have random particles (in multidimensional space) pop in and out of existence, I wonder what is the case with the thing that happens/exists between two such pops - possibly happening simultaneously !?! There has got to be some empty space concept or our entire premise seems to me like a meaningless premise.
I think the concept is more like string theory adjusted to 3d space. Can it be possible?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/#comment-353526&quot;&gt;sheshankjoshi&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the key ideas that emerge from modern physics is that there is no such thing as &#039;empty space&#039;. What we call space could be said to consist of the fundamental quantum fields. As Matt explained in this and many other postings, a particle is a regular ripple in its corresponding field, often continually interacting with at least one other field. For example, an electron speeding through &#039;empty&#039; space is rippling through its own electron field, and also continually deriving its mass from the Higgs field and its unit of negative charge from the photon field. So we have to deduce that these fields occupy every point of space.
The electron is stable, but the same principle applies to your question about an unstable particle. Suppose it is a muon. Rippling through space in the muon field, it is drawing 207 times as much mass from the Higgs field as its lighter cousin, the electron, while having the same charge interaction with the photon field. After about 2 microseconds, it interacts with the Weak field, which transfers its properties into new ripples in other fields, most likely the electron and neutrino fields.
I hope this is a basically correct and helpful explanation. But, as a non-scientist, I would very much appreciate confirmation and more detail from experts. I am particularly puzzled by how every point of &#039;space&#039; can everywhere contain all the fundamental fields...?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the article. I have a doubt though. 
If a particular non-stable particle has to break down does it have to interact with anything? Suppose if I assume that I leave a particular particle (unstable) in empty space alone, with any other particle absent or is some billions of light years away, will it still decay into stable ones?
Does relativity has any effect on decay in this scenario?]]></description>

Particles decay because of the vacuum present throughout space ! This force is always pulling on matter &#038; eventually this force wins !
