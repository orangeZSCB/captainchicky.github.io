					<description><![CDATA[Its been really usefull. Thankeow.  I was writing on particle decay on my blog and you have provided very good information.  I will leave a link on my blog featuring your post. Its good to see that people write on phisics. I love phisics thankeow again.]]></description>

You&#039;d better reread the article.  They didn&#039;t conclude that electrons decayed.  They put a lower bound on the half-life.  Their results were consistent with no decay.  (It&#039;s impossible to measure exactly zero decay; one can only put an upper bound on the decay rate, or lower bound on the decay half-life.)]]></description>

There&#039;s no such thing as energy divorced from particles.  Energy conservation means that the decay particle&#039;s energy must go into the product particles.  Yes, some energy does go off in light that&#039;s not explicitly included in the reaction as written out. (Radiative corrections.)  The amount is almost always negligible.]]></description>

Step 4 has a serious problem.  The antiprotons would occasionally collide with the protons, and annihilate them, producing products we would detect.  Also the remaining electrons in particular distributed throughout the universe would cause a fog obscuring everything else.]]></description>

I think that if the decay products are exactly stationary (in the frame of the initial particle), you get the same potential problem as one particle decaying to one particle -- the process can reverse and one has instead a mixing.]]></description>

X -&#062; e- + v + p+ -- that&#039;s exactly what happens when a free neutron decays, with v as the electron&#039;s antineutrino.

I think that when looking for the asymmetry between particles and antiparticles, we should consider quarks rather than protons.  The complications of combining quarks to form protons would confound the analysis.]]></description>
