					<description><![CDATA[hello, 
let alone which theoretical model fits the data best, don&#039;t you see a life-like behaviour here?

I mean: I see a complex &quot;entity&quot; using energy received from the environment for replicating itself... don&#039;t you?

regards,
corrado]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/#comment-14220&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

&quot;electron + proton -&#062; neutron + neutrino&quot;  I&#039;ve been all over your site today trying to find precisely this statement (or at least a very similar statement) so that I could ask you this question.  Is it possible to simulate this effect (I believe it is called electron capture when it occurs in a nucleus) by using a collider to collide protons and electrons to generate neutrons (and neutrinos)?  If so, could you please direct me to an article perhaps that discusses the conditions that would need to be present for this to occur. In a discussion on the subject, the push back was that this couldn&#039;t occur and that other products would result.  Thanks very much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am sure this will be considered a silly question, so let me preface it.  I am sometimes frustrated by descriptions in physics, both mathematical and physical, that are not describing what is actually observed but rather the interpretation of what is actually observed based upon some existing theory.  With regard to gluons that are emitted from quarks, how does one know these are absorbed by other quarks rather than merely sent off on their own?  i am not asking for the theory about their being absorbed.  i am asking if it has actually be observed that a gluon that was emitted by a quark was instantly absorbed by another?  Likewise, there is some indication that photons are emitted by quarks as well, presumably these are not absorbed by other quarks - as they are neutral particles - what is the explanation for photons being emitted due to collisions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I usually doo not create a lot of comments, but i did a 
few searching and wound upp here Jets: Thhe Manifestation of 
Quarks and Gluons &#124; Of Particular Significance. And 
I ddo have a couple of questions for you if you do not mind.

Is it simply mee or does it give the impression like some of these remarks 
look like left by brain deaad visitors? :-P And, if you are writing oon additional online sites, 
I&#039;d like to keep up with everything new you have to post.
Could you mzke a list of alll of all your social pages like your Facebook 
page, twitter feed, oor linkedin profile?]]></description>
