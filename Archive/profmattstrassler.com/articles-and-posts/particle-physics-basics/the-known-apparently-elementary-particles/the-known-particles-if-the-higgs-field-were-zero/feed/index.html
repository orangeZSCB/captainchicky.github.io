					<description><![CDATA[Isn’t this in the Bible? Specifically in the book of Ezekiel 1:1-28 where God is described as a single unified force (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), that undergoes a radioactive decay into to four forces that are controlled by cheribum (bosons), which in turn control “wheels within wheels,” (solar system &#038; atomic orbitals)? Furthermore, wouldn’t it be plausible that these angelic or celestial beings, which hold massive amounts of information, would be described as having the head of a lion, ox, eagle, and man, which may not only represent faces of a crystalline core at the heart of a star, but information that has not yet been dispersed in to various individual sentient life forms, by space and time? Could the “Christ” iteration of God also being described  as the “Image” of God in whom “all things were created,” be a nod to supersymmetry? If not, what would be the mathematical probability that such a strong correlation would be a coincidence?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don’t know if you – or many readers – still come to this 7-year-old page, Prof. Strassler. But I’m not so sure about the Higgs and gravity being unrelated. I suspect that an approach using what I call vector-tensor-scalar geometry shows that they definitely are related. Here’s my (rather lengthy) explanation, extracted from an article I wrote for myself (your website has omitted the diagram, I see) –
SECTION 1 – MATTER, AND THE HIGGS BOSON, EMERGING FROM PHOTON-GRAVITON INTERACTION 
Figure 1 –
VISUALIZING QUANTUM SPIN AND VECTOR/TENSOR/SCALAR QUANTITIES
(drawn by author using Microsoft’s “Paint” program) 
Particles can be produced by the theory that mass emerges from electromagnetic and gravitational waves interacting via vector-tensor-scalar geometry. The vectors of photon and graviton (the waves’ excitations) are represented by two adjoining sides – one horizontal, one vertical – of a parallelogram as well as by their resultant diagonal. When changing from the coordinates of the sides and diagonal to those of a single, scalar^ point on the diagonal; tensor calculus requires transformation in a precise manner. In this case, quantum spin will be addressed and the calculus begins with Stephen Hawking’s observation that “What the spin of a particle really tells us is what the particle looks like from different directions.” (1) Like an arrow with one tip pointing upward, the spin-1 photon must be turned one full revolution (360 degrees) to look the same and again be pointing up. Like an arrow with two tips (one pointed up, one down), the spin-2 graviton must be turned half a revolution (180 degrees) to look the same. Its constant interaction with the photon means it turns two half-revolutions while the photon turns one revolution. The half of the diagonal representing the photon can be assigned the value 1 while the half portraying the graviton is ½ + ½. 
^ A scalar quantity is completely described by its magnitude, is without direction, and is associated with spin-0 particles. It is representable by a position on a line which, in the diagram above, is the central blue and black dot on the diagonal. 
The next step in the calculus is to balance the arithmetic (equivalent to performing the same operation on both sides of an equation). Since one half of the diagonal was subject to addition (½ + ½), interaction with the other half-diagonal must be subjected to subtraction
1 – (½ + ½) or (½ + ½) – 1
In either case, the result is spin 0 (turning through zero revolutions to look the same) 
Matter and antimatter can exist because division is the same as repeated subtraction e.g. 4 subtracted from 20 five times equals zero, therefore 20 ÷ 4 = 5. Instead of repeating the subtraction used above,^ the photon’s spin is divided by the graviton’s spin and this leads to production of matter particles of spin 1 / 2. (In terms of Stephen Hawking’s observation that “What the spin of a particle really tells us is what the particle looks like from different directions”, the quantum spin of matter particles is 1/1 divided by 2/1 ie 1/1 multiplied by ½ = 1 / 2.) In other words, photon-graviton interaction forms the emergent property of mass (just as hydrogen-oxygen interaction produces wetness) and if the mass emerging from photon-graviton interaction is 125 GeV/c2 (with spin 0), the Higgs boson becomes a by-product of the former interaction (relating the graviton to the supposedly unrelated Higgs boson, as well as the gravitational field to the allegedly unrelated Higgs field).
SECTION 3 – ATOMIC WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE, POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF VIRTUAL PARTICLES/HIDDEN VARIABLES, AND ATOMIC STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE 
3.1 – ATOMIC WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE
The photon must interact with the graviton to produce the mass of the weak nuclear force’s W and Z bosons. To produce their quantum spin, the photon’s spin 1 needs to react with the graviton’s spin 2. That is, the photon’s turning through one complete revolution needs to be combined with the graviton’s being turned through two half-revolutions. Incorporating the time factor as a reversal of time^ in the middle of the interaction: a gravitonic half revolution is subtracted from the photonic full revolution then the graviton’s time-reversal adds a half revolution (1-½+½ = the spin 1 of W and Z bosons). The W+ and W- each have masses of approx. 80 GeV/c2, the Z’s mass is approx. 91 GeV/c2, and the Higgs boson is approx. 125 GeV/c2. The particles absorb energy from the virtual particles^^ filling space, time, and matter as they travel or vibrate. Since virtual particles produce mass and photons and gravitons interact to produce mass, virtual particles could be the building blocks of photons and gravitons.]]></description>
