					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt. Thank you for your reply. The reason I said that the Standard Model predicts that the negative contribution to vacuum energy of fermion fields is greater than the positive contribution to vacuum energy of boson fields is that in your article above you say
&quot;Well, you can do this calculation, and in the Standard Model youâ€™ll see it doesnâ€™t work; there are way too many fermions, and there should be a huge negative energy in empty space.&quot;
For me the Standard Model and the particles it currently contains are very well experimentally confirmed whereas quantum gravity, GUTs, hypothetical particles etc are speculative at present. Therefore, it put more importance on the fact that the Standard Model predicts a huge negative contribution to the vacuum energy. Clearly, either a huge positive energy or huge negative energy is totally at odds with experimental findings, as the former predicts a massive acceleration of the scale factor and the latter a massive deceleration - even worse!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/#comment-391561&quot;&gt;Julian Collins&lt;/a&gt;.

You made a couple of wrong assumptions here.  Let&#039;s assume the world is only the Standard Model plus some particles that make a consistent theory of quantum gravity; otherwise I don&#039;t know what we&#039;re talking about.  Now, the issues.   

First, either a huge positive cosmological constant or a huge negative cosmological constant is a tremendous problem, because they both disagree with data.  It&#039;s the absolute value that is the problem, not the sign, and I personally don&#039;t assume the sign is positive and don&#039;t think most of colleagues do.  The problem isn&#039;t what it would be in some imaginary world.  The problem is that in our world the absolute value is tiny, which apparently requires extraordinary cancellations among positive and negative contributions. 

Second, you said &quot;if the negative fermion vacuum energy is much greater than the positive boson vacuum energy&quot; but I don&#039;t remember saying that and am not sure why you are saying it.  Neither one can be calculated without a theory of gravity.  All I know is that I have large positive numbers added to large negative numbers, such as sum could be positive or negative, as in 10^9-10^10 vs 10^9-10^8.  Perhaps you were counting the number of fermions and the number of bosons, and trying to assume that the contribution of each fermion is minus the contribution of each boson?  That assumption need not be true and is highly unstable to effects at the highest energy scales at which the theory is valid.

  Third, you have forgotten that there are also classical contributions to the cosmological constant, which in the Standard Model can be thought of as contributions from particles that might exist with masses up at gravitational scales.  There is also energy from phase transitions, such as the one that occurs in QCD; these could occur as part of the quantum gravity sector.  What this means is that the cosmological constant simply can&#039;t be calculated within the Standard Model; the gravity sector can make an equally large or larger contribution, positive or negative.]]></description>
