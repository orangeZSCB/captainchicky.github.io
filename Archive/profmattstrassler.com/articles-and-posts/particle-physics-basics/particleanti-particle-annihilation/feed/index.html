					<description><![CDATA[I am uncomfortable with your assertion that mass is not conserved (eg. in section 1) because &quot;the final mass is zero&quot;. While it is true that each photon, individually, is massless, a system comprising multiple photons moving in different directions has non-zero mass. The invariant mass of a composite system is not the sum of the rest masses of the parts, unless all the parts are at rest and are unbound by mutual forces. 

The system you show comprises two photons moving apart with equal and opposite momentum. Taken together as a system, whose boundary is defined by your &quot;shoebox&quot;, the two-photon system has an invariant mass of 2Mc^2. I don&#039;t have an authoritative reference to give for that, but the wikipedia page on &quot;Invariant Mass&quot; covers it in a way I believe to be correct. It is this which can be compared with the initial state (two muons in a shoebox) which had an invariant mass of 2Mc^2, and sure enough, the mass of the system is conserved. What you have done in the last sentence of section 1 is to neglect the shoebox defining the system, treat the photons as free individuals, and so end up comparing unlike things which are not alternative states of the same isolated system. 

As you state on other pages of your site, the mass of a system is not the sum of the masses of the components. So why do you add up that sum in this case (two photons of zero mass) and declare that &quot;the final mass is zero&quot;? It&#039;s calculations like that which have caused endless confusion over the years and led many to explain the difference by the voodoo process of &quot;converting&quot; mass into energy. Rest masses are not additive; get over it, and stop doing these kind of sums. Any time you are looking at a body comprising more than one elementary particle, you have a system, and you need to define consistent boundaries for it and stick to them. When you do so, the only mass that is physically meaningful is the invariant mass of that system. If that system is isolated, you will then find that mass is conserved, whatever reactions go on inside it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particleanti-particle-annihilation/#comment-50684&quot;&gt;carlmott5520&lt;/a&gt;.

Over six years ago, from this forum discussion, a thought came to me that there is no such thing as ‘vacuum’ in the universe, and the universe is in a process of phase transition. The ordered phase is transforming into galaxies. All galaxies are in a macroscopic single state, much like super fluid He3 with no temperature. Outside galaxies, it is the disordered phase with a bone cracking cold temperature of 2.7 K, and light travels slower outside galaxies than inside galaxies. 
With this thought, that there is a perfect plan wave running in the background of every galaxies, some deep puzzles in physics can be explained. Like the entanglement experiment of two particles, where the oscillatory state of each particle in no way can be determined, but when the relative phase of their oscillatory states is checked (entangled), and afterwards they have been separated thousands of miles apart, at that time, if the oscillatory state of one particle is checked, the state of the other particle can be determined with absolute certainty. These events of absolute uncertainty and certainty can’t be the act of individual particles but the act of a plan wave motion that may exist in the galaxy.
Recently, I went ocean fishing, where I saw speed boats running on ocean surface wave in a harbor. At certain speed, the up and down motion of speed boat became harmonic with the ocean wave and it started skipping the wave with a rhythm of its own.  A particle as big as a speed boat can behave like a wave just by riding one, and it can do so at any speed, but for a particle to behave like a plan wave, it has to move at a speed that is an integer times the speed of the plan wave that it is riding on. It occurred to me that I had seen electrons doing just like that.
More than twenty years ago, I used to use Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) routinely in my surface physics study. LEED is a simple device for checking surface crystal structure of a material. It has an electron gun mounted at the center of a half spherical screen and a voltage control for changing electron speed. The electron gun shoots electrons perpendicularly at a sample mounted in front of the gun, and the back scattered electrons form a diffract pattern on the screen. I was puzzled then by the fact that a sharp diffraction pattern is not observed with a continuous voltage change, but only at a set of 4-5 discrete voltages within a range of 0-200 volts. The voltage of the first diffraction pattern observed is around 10 Volt. At this voltage, from eV = 1/2mv2 , the electron speed out of the electron gun is 1.9 x 106 m/s. For electrons to act like a plane wave again at a higher speed, they have to double, triple or quadruple this minimum speed. As the voltage is proportional to the square of velocity, the set of voltages that diffraction pattern can be observed is, 10, 40, 90, 160 in the 0-200V range. 
I remember that the voltage settings I used to use were around this set of values, but the settings varied from time to time. When I search online, there are also different set of voltages used.  Actually, the variation of this set voltages from one LEED experiment to another is a better evidence that the electrons are riding on the galaxy wave. The 1.9 x 10 6 m/s minimum speed is not the speed of electrons in the galaxy frame but their speed relative to earth. Three factors may affect the speed of electrons in the galaxy frame. Earth surface velocity, which has a maximum value at equator, is only 460 m/s, that can be ignored. Earth orbital velocity around sun is 3 x 10 4 m/s, a factor about 1%, that may not be easy observable can also be ignored. Sun orbital velocity on the Milky Way plane is 0.2 x 10 6 m/s, that is a factor of 10% on electron speed in the galaxy frame. A 10% variation in velocity corresponds to a variation of 20% in voltage. This variation should be observable from one experiment lab to another, as the orientation of the electron gun is likely different from one lab to another. Even in the same lab, as earth rotates, the orientation of the electron gun with respect to the sun orbital direction changes during a day. If one takes a set of measurements of voltages that diffraction patterns are observed in the morning, and takes another set of measurements in the afternoon, and if a variation on the two sets of measurements is observed, one can be sure that one is seeing the galaxy wave in motion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find it interesting that although it is obvious that all matter particles, energy photons and even fields are composed of the same thing that is called energy, which is always conserved and can generate various different observable output results in interactions between such entities, such as the 3 dimensionally stable static mass effect of matter particles, the dynamic mass effect of energy photons that operates at ninety degrees to its direction of travel that varies in amplitude in direct relation to the frequency of the photon that generates the photoelectric effect by freeing electrons from their atoms if the photon&#039;s frequency (energy content) is high enough, the ability of matter particles to stand still in relation to other matter particles, the constant motion of energy photons at the speed of light, etc.  Since one entity (energy) creates the structure of each of these entities, it is apparent that this energy must be structured differently in matter particles than it is in energy photons, such that it generates properties in matter particles that are greatly different than those of energy photons, etc.  I see very little explanation of what the basic energy structuring substance is composed of or how that substance is structured or built up in each of these entities in such a way as to generate its observed output results in interactions.  It seems that people are satisfied to just note the output effects of photons and matter particles, etc. and the probabilities of occurrence of generation of each effect during interactions, etc., and the ways that each entity can be transformed into each of the others, etc., but care very little about the ways that the particles are constructed internally to generate those output results and how the transformation from one entity into another entity works internally within the entity.  It appears to me that such an understanding and a workable model of how the mechanisms can work is not exceptionally difficult to accomplish.  This has been done on the molecular and atomic entity scales, so why hasn&#039;t it been done on the basic particle scale?]]></description>
