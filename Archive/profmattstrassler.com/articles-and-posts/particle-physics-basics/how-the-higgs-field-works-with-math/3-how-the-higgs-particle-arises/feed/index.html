					<description><![CDATA[Would you please tell me what the potential is at the center peak of the so called mexican hat? I realize the trough value is 246 GeV.
Thank ,

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Dr.Strassler
Under the Fig.2, a statement you wrote is that &quot;For the Higgs, as for any field we would find in nature, the Class -1 equation is modified by terms that limits the exponential growth and prevents the field from going off to infinity.&quot;
I want to check that the terms you said that limits the exponential growth is -b^2 H^3?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/3-how-the-higgs-particle-arises/#comment-109115&quot;&gt;Richard Carter&lt;/a&gt;.

Richard, the reason you&#039;re confused is that the ν_min (from &quot;Particles are Quanta&quot;) is a greek letter nu, representing a frequency.  It is an entirely different quantity from the Higgs value &#039;v&#039; used in this article, and therefore does not cancel out when you (correctly) put 2 b² v² = (2 π v_min)² = [2 π (m_h c² / h)]², and thus m_h² = 2 b² v² / (2 π c² / h)² = 2 (h/2π)² b² v² / c^4.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am enjoying these articles but am confused by the last part of this one. You give the formula for the mass of the Higgs particle as mh =  √2  (h / 2 π) b v / c², but if h(x,t) has a Class 1 equation of motion (approximately) why isn&#039;t mh=hv/c²? Obviously, this can&#039;t be right otherwise mh would be 246GeV/c², and would have been known as soon as the equilibrium frequency was determined. So there seems to be a contradiction here. Where does the formula mh =  √2  (h / 2 π) b v / c² come from? Naively, I put 2b²v²=(2 πv)² and substituted v=mhc²/h in the LHS to arrive at your formula, but this only works if  b=√2π since I am using the fact that mh=hv/c². Clearly, I&#039;m missing something.]]></description>
