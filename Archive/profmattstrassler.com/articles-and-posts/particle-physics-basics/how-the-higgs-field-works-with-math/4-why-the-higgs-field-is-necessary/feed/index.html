					<description><![CDATA[Just an editorial comment:  The constant &quot;c&quot; seems to have been omitted from the left side of some of the later equations, such as

dψ/dt – dψ/dx = (2π c^2/h) y (v + h) χ

I know there&#039;s a convention to choose units such that c=1, so it can be omitted to simplify equations, but the &quot;c&quot; appears on the right side of the equation, so it&#039;s a bit confusing.  Earlier in the article the &quot;c&quot; appeared on the left side too.

I also have a dumb question.  This article is entitled &quot;Why the Higgs Field is Necessary&quot;, but it seems more like an explanation of why the neutrino is necessary.  The two equations in green contain the mass factor m on the right side, and the article explains that these equations can&#039;t be right, because they imply that the two electron fields are strictly proportional, whereas we know experimentally that the W field only interacts with one and not the other.  Fair enough.  The resolution is to introduce the neutrino field, and have the W field interacting with the neutrino and one of the two electron fields.  Along the way, the mass factor m is replaced with y(v+h), but it isn&#039;t clear (to me) how this replacement contributes to the resolution of the problem raised by the W interaction.  I think that problem is solved just by introducing the neutrino field and the W terms.  So my question is, what would be wrong with the equations

        dψ/dt – c dψ/dx =    (2π c2/h) m χ
        dχ/dt + c dχ/dx + g W- ν =   – (2π c2/h) m ψ
        dν/dt + c dν/dx + g W+ χ = 0

These are the final set of equations in the article, except I&#039;ve replaced the quantity y(v + h) with the symbol &quot;m&quot;.  I think h is not constant, but it&#039;s very close to zero (right?), so we essentially have just the product of the constants y and v.  Why is it necessary to represent the mass m as the product of a coupling constant y and a constant average Higgs field v?  (I think I understand why it&#039;s possible, but not why it&#039;s necessary.)]]></description>

Matt. Thanks for your explanation. yes, for massless spin 0 particle seems to have 1 helicity state. what I meant was, is it not the case that only a massless particle with non-zero spin can have only two helicity states (+ or - of spin direction along its traveling axis) but what about massive ones? Does a massive particle with non-zero spin also always have two helicity states? or does it always (or except specific cases) have more than two?

You said &quot;No assumption was made about what the massless particle’s spin axis was before the measurement.&quot; but what do you mean by this? The question was &quot;if we measure the massless particle’s non-zero spin, is it always found along its traveling direction&quot;? (or does it make sense theoretically that it always points to its traveling direction even if we do not measure it?) If it is always found along its traveling direction, why? because massless particles cannot have any observable components (vibration/amplitude of wave etc.) along its traveling direction?? A massless particle (=wave) cannot vibrate along its traveling direction because it(=the wave) &quot;cannot have (observable?) thickness&quot; along its traveling direction due to length (Lorentz) contraction? What is the explanation/reason behind this?]]></description>

No. Particles with different spin have different counting rules, and massless particles have different counting rules from massive ones.  It is not the case that all massless particles have the same number of helicity states.  The counting you are giving is for massless spin-one particles.  Massless spin-zero particles have 1 helicity state, for instance.

As for why (or if) the axis is along or opposite the traveling direction; this is quantum mechanics, and spin is very much a quantum mechanical effect, and very non-intuitive.  You cannot make all the measurements you could make in non-quantum physics, say, on a baseball, which can spin however it likes relative to its travel direction, and whose spin and travel direction you can measure with complete freedom.  You asked, `why “massless particle’s spin axis” is always found along its traveling direction?`  But that wasn&#039;t the question, or the assumption.  The question was &quot;if we measure the massless particle&#039;s spin via its component along the traveling direction, what do we find?&quot;  The answer is the helicity.  No assumption was made about what the massless particle&#039;s spin axis was before the measurement.  Quantum mechanics tells us that the answer to this measurement will only have one of a finite number of values; the number of possible values is the set of possible helicities for a particle of a particular spin, massless or massive.]]></description>

&quot;two helicity states for a &quot;massive&quot; fermion&quot;?

Is it not the case that only a &quot;massless&quot; particle can have two helicity states(=spin directions?) + and - along its traveling direction such as a photon or gluon?
