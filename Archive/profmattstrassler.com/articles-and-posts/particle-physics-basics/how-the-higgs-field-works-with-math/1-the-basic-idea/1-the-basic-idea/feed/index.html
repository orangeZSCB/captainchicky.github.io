And why the highest possible value for the Yuwaka factor is 1? What prevents it from being, like, 2?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Higgs Field average value is ~246 GeV, the W mass is ~80 GeV, so the Yukawa factor for the H-W interation is 80/246 =~ 0.325? Did I get this right?
So, If the mass contribution comes from the Higgs only, the highest possible mass is 246 GeV?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just curious about the small terms in the equations that are ignored. How would the classical solution to the coupled field equations behave if the small terms were not ignored? 

If initially I had a vibration in just one field, would the small interaction terms cause the other field to start vibrating? What would the result be over a long period of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Zeynel :-) . Thanx a lot for your response. Thanx also for your link, that was great too. I just plugged some numbers in the m = hV/c^2 formula, specifically the mass of the electron, and solved for V (minimum frequency). The result I got for the minimum frequency for an electron is about 12,37x10^10GHertz. This is actually near the soft gamma rays part of the spectrum. I also found that photons at that frequencies turn into electron-positron pairs (through a process called photon to photon physics or gamma ‚Äì gamma physics). At higher frequencies at the hard gamma rays end they turn into quark ‚Äì antiquark pairs. Should it be fair to assume that the Higgs field ‚Äútransforms‚Äù very high-energy photons into particles with mass? So lower energy photons (everyday electromagnetic waves) because of their ‚Äúlarge‚Äù wavelength do not interact with the Higgs field thus they remain massless? Obviously the neutrinos (Mass &#060;0,13eV) get their masses (if they have any) indirectly. I guess my train of thought must be over simplified or probably I‚Äôm talking nonsense :- ).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vasilis, I don&#039;t know what Prof. Strassler&#039;s answer will be, but his first sentence in this post may be of help: &quot;all the elementary ‚Äúparticles‚Äù are really quanta (i.e. waves whose amplitude and energy are the minimum allowed by quantum mechanics) in relativistic quantum fields&quot;. So there are no particles only waves. You may also check first few slides in this presentation: .http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~strassler/QuestHiggs.pdf]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Professor.   Thanks for the amazing articles. I‚Äôm not a physicist so my question might be very naive. I hope I won‚Äôt bother you too much. It is said that particles gain their masses through their interaction with the Higgs field. The ‚Äúbigger‚Äù the particle the greater the interaction with the field, the larger the mass obtained by the particle. What I don‚Äôt understand is, what it meant by the ‚Äúbigger‚Äù the particle. How can it be big if it has no mass yet (mass is obtained after the interaction with the field). Does it mean that it has larger energy (through E=mc2)? If that is the explanation, then by larger energy does it means higher frequency (through E=hœâ)? 
Thanks a lot for your time. I hope I didn‚Äôt tired you too much.]]></description>
