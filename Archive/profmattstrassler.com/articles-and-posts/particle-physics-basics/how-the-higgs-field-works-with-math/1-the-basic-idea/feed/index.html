					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the amazing articles.  
Is this sentence in section 1 paragraph 2 : &quot; A few fields satisfy Class 0 equations, which are just Class 1 equations where the quantity νmin is zero. The quanta of such fields have mass&quot; a typo?
Aren&#039;t the particles of fields that satisfy Class 0 equations massless?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Matt.

Remember the &#039;good old days&#039;, back when physics was easy? There was only one force... the Unified Force. Ah, we were happy in those days. Simpler times. Then those darned kids came along with their long hair and music so loud it broke the symmetry. What a mess. Neutrons and protons living together, electrons dancing around everywhere. The universe went all hippie-dippie. Get off my quantum field, you damn kids! LOL

When the Electroweak Force symmetry broke, it gave rise to the Higgs field.

Does this imply that when the Unified Force symmetry broke into the Electronuclear Force and Gravity, and when the Electronuclear Force symmetry broke into the Strong Nuclear Force and Electroweak Force, that it similarly gave rise to fields?

If so, what are those fields, and what effects do they have?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am interested in whether you feel that it is possible to modulate the Higgs Field in order to compensate for the increase in mass experienced by interstellar space ships traveling at relativistic speeds.
Please respond to Drbillg@comcast.net
Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you think that it is possible to modulate the Higgs field using an interference pattern. If so it would be useful in relativistic space travel to combat the increase the mass of the spaceship at relativistic speeds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you greatly for very accessible explanations.  I&#039;ve read that ~99% of mass of proton comes from the kinetic energy of its quarks and the energy of the gluon mediated fields.  How does this kinetic energy contribute to mass?  Is there a deeper understanding than E=m*c^2?  Does it have something to do with the moving quarks encountering more Higgs field?
Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey there! This is my 1st comment here so I just wanted to 
give a quick shout out and say I truly enjoy reading 
through your posts. Can you recommend any other blogs/websites/forums that deal with the same subjects?
Thanks for your time!]]></description>
