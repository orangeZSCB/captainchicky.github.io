					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/2-why-the-higgs-field-is-non-zero-on-average/#comment-23145&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

In relation to the questions raised by Mike Perkins and Jon Lennox - why H is (more or less ) constant? What would happen if we would have only HH* constant and allow H to vary? Is there some reason we can&#039;t assume that?
&quot;Even naively, H(x,t) is not necessarily constant over time and space. However, in most places and at most times, it is constant, because it naturally settles down to a constant value if left alone&quot; - this settling down is some experimental outcome or it results from the theory? Are we able to measure value of H or only HH*?   
It is really disturbing to me, that we have some field with non zero average out of nowhere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[what really gets me is why you guys have to start with something that does not have mass, when they obvously do.
No closer to perdict the value of the masses, as far as I know.
Have you fallen for this buisness that the dirac eq. has particles of speed c?

You have basically the enm wave equation, with a right hand nonlinear inhomogeneous term...suggests you want
to give photons a mass,, does not sound logical.]]></description>
