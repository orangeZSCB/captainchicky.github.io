					<description><![CDATA[Matt, first I hope you are well and able to further your research in these difficult times. Some time ago you kindly elucidated the possibility that protons and neutrons in the nucleus are partly bonded by the exchange of positive pions, in the process perhaps even swapping identities! Now the science mags seem abuzz with two interconnected ideas that both also have implications for your topic ‘What’s a Proton, anyway?’. I’d appreciate your take on these.
The first is the Seaquest project, and their release of findings that protons contain more anti-down quarks than anti-up quarks. Numerous explanations have been published for this apparent ‘Antimatter Asymmetry in Protons’; but one touches particularly on the role of pions, the so-called ‘Pion Cloud’. Sometimes a proton emits a positive pion (up quark + down antiquark) and rapidly reabsorbs it. It is the presence of these exposed down antiquarks that some proton collision experiments have recorded as giving something like a 40% preponderance of downs over up antiquarks. 

I’d love to know if this is solid science or another case of ‘jumping the gun’!]]></description>
