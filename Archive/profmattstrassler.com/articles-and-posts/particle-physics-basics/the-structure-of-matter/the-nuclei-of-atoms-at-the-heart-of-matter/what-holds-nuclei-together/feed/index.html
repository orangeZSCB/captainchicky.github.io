					<description><![CDATA[In your article, it is noted that strong nuclear interaction is a very complex phe-nomenon. In particular, a graph is given of the dependence of the number of pro-tons on the number of neutrons in stable nuclei. You indicated that this graph has no convincing explanations. However, these explanations are easily given by the Unified Theory of Nature (see my-gravity.com). Its power and universality is proved on 140 examples of its application (see Universality of the Unified Theory). Part of the answers to the riddles in your article are outlined in Nuclear Interac-tion and Theoretical Physics, Nuclear Interaction and Unified Theory. A little later I will publish the missing answers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact is that balance of forces between neutrons in nucleus is impossible.
For example He-4 nucleus is a rotating complex of four nucleons (attracted to each other by the strong nuclear force), of which neutron A and neutron B. A simple analysis of the attracion force and the centrifugal force indicates that balance is inpossible for any stereo metric complex. Considering tetrahedric symmetry neutron A is attracted by the other three nucleons by a consistent force, perpendicular to the rotation axe, so that the attracion can be balanced by a centrifugal force. However the location of neutron B has not possibility for balancing the attraction by a centrifugal force. 
Is the QCD concept correct?
We have to consider the possibility of a terrible mistake, from year 1936 to accept that neutron is not an electron-proton complex of size much larger than proton and  with a structure showing spin 1/2. Stereo metric approach demonstrates the balance of electric, strong nuclear and centrifugal forces of nuclei composed by protons.
Dear Matt Strassler I accept that it is dificult to accept this revolutionar concept.
In the references here below, are details of myToE based on stable cyclonic structure of electron (thin ring of large radius) and proton (donut) in ideal gass (old idea of Lord Kelvin), explaining the electric and the nuclear forces as winds created by the two cyclonic eyes (ring and axial) of the particle and the gravity by the diffusion resulting from the pressure gradient.
I am at your disposal for details.
