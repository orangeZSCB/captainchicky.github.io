You talk a good game.  But you understand neither the science nor the pedagogical issues involved.

You haven&#039;t understood the scientific point that the identity of atoms of the same isotope is independent of context, so talking about them as being different in a particular context isn&#039;t relevant. If their identity *did* depend on context, all sorts of aspects of physics would be different.  In particular, you wouldn&#039;t be able to swap out one atom and replace it with another of the same isotope.  In other words: in the word &quot;pointless&quot;, you can say that one of the &quot;s&quot;&#039;s is different from the other because of context -- it comes at the end.  But when I switch them, I get the word &quot;pointless&quot;, which, according to you, is different from the one I started with, but according to me is the same word.  Your example of Hydrogen is exactly of this type.

Answering your other question is pointless.  I mean, pointless.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Prof
your comments about the identity of isotopes is not correct - quite. In making it, you assume, without saying so explicitly, that each atom may assume any position in space, with the probability of being there given by the appropriate choice of statistics (Maxwell, Fermi or Bose-Einstein, as dictated by Z, temperature, crystal lattice{superconductivity!}, etc). This is a valid assumption for situations where the position of one atom does not depend upon the position of another atom. In a chemical compound, where atoms are held in (almost) fixed positions relative to each other, this assumption is no longer true. This is borne out by all the spectroscopic methods used by organic chemists, be it infrared, Raman, visible light, nuclear magnetic resonance . . .
Take the hydrogen molecule as an example: If the two atoms are not bonded, the probability of each atom to have an up spin is independent of that of the other atom, it is 50%. Once they bond together as a single molecule,  only one can have the up spin, the other must have a down spin. That is a consequence of the Pauli principle. And because their spin is different, they no longer are identical.

In general, I find your approach to chemical bonding questionable, if not misleading. For example, I would never call NaCl to be a molecule. To be able to do so, I would demand to be able to determine which Cl atom is bonded to which Na atom, an impossibility since each Cl atom in the NaCl lattice is equally distant to six Na atoms, and vice versa. Please read also what the Wikipedia has to say about Daltonide and Berthollide compounds (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berthollide) and consider that non-stoichiometry is by no means rare among compounds, but rather mandated by thermodynamics.
When you discussed the internal structure of the atom (https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/), you set yourself up for the long and fruitless discussion with Kudzu. What is missing there is the deBroglie wavelength of an electron at the energy of a chemical bond, i.e. at 1 eV or a fraction thereof. From there, it would have been rather obvious that chemical bonds must be treated within the context of the Schrödinger equation, i.e. as a standing wave of (several) electrons shrouding the nucleus and not as dimensionless charges flitting about the nucleus. Then you could have introduced the quantum numbers n, l and s, which ultimately determine whether a chemical bond will form, the bonding angle and the bonding distance.
It&#039;ll be interesting to see how you extricate yourself from the mess you have put yourself into.

To stick to the &#039;But it could be!&#039; line is to take a stand with those who think the earth is 6000 years old. It would require a massive and systematic and utterly unlikely failure of basic experiments.]]></description>

That&#039;s all the uncertainty principle &quot;says&quot;, when you write it in words.  But when you write it in math, it says much more.  You&#039;re incorrect about the math.

What the math says is that there&#039;s no meaning to the questions that you are asking.

Now maybe the math is incomplete.  But again, it&#039;s been shown, using the math and testing it using experiments, that nothing so simple as &quot;hidden variables&quot; (&lt;em&gt;(i.e., the idea that you are espousing, that the particle has both a position and velocity, you just can&#039;t measure it)&lt;/em&gt; can be consistent with &lt;strong&gt;DATA.&lt;/strong&gt;  That&#039;s the Bell inequality and its generalizations.  This is not an interpretation issue.  It&#039;s a &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt; issue.  You&#039;re ignoring data.  That&#039;s illegal in physics.

Why don&#039;t you go learn about this and leave us alone until you understand it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-of-an-isotope-are-identical-literally/#comment-60183&quot;&gt;Sam Seven&lt;/a&gt;.

The uncertainty principle is a manifestation of the basic nature of particles. They are not &#039;small hard balls&#039; like we tend to imagine them. They are waves like the waves on the ocean (but in three dimensions.) This means that any given particle is not a &#039;fixed&#039; object that remains the same whether or not we can measure it. Instead when we measure a property we arrange that particle in a particular way.

Imagine trying to measure the *exact* position of a wave in a pond. A wave has no clearly defined edge there, it curves into the flat surface of the pond gradually. So its position is not exact, there is uncertainty in it. (We could try and define the position of the exact center of the wave, but to find *that* exactly we need to measure the edges of the wave exactly.)

The only way we can improve the accuracy is to somehow &#039;squash&#039; the wave into a smaller volume of space, make it more like a point particle. There is in fact a way to do this; instead of having a wave with a single momentum, we can make the wave by combining a number of lesser waves. These will interfere in a manner such that the resulting wave will occupy a smaller and smaller volume of space, allowing its position to be known more and more accurately. Shown here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Sequential_superposition_of_plane_waves.gif

But what have we done by making the wave out of all these &#039;sub waves&#039;? Each wave can be considered as being the same particle but having a different frequency (Thus energy and thus momentum) So in making our wave&#039;s position more accurate we have made its momentum (and by relation, speed) less accurate, not obscured.

This can be considered similar to the observer effect which basically states that with a rough observation what is being observed will be altered. Many people think this explains the uncertainty principle, that somehow all our measurements of say, speed, must disturb the system&#039;s position and that the &#039;real&#039; position was there, just unobservable. but in fact we can see this effect even without measuring a system.

We can look for experimental evidence for this and one of the best is to pass a laser beam through an adjustable slit. As the slit is narrowed at first the beam that emerges from the slit narrows too; this is logic, less of the beam can get through a narrower slit.

But eventually something strange happens, the beam begins to *widen* actually it begins to disperse, to radiate out in a fan from the slit. This is because to have passed through the slit the photons must have been in a small volume of space, their position must have been quite accurate. Because of the way the world works their momentum becomes less certain. The beam that passes through the slit is now not a laser beam of particles all moving in the same direction but a spreading, radiating beam.

But nothing has been measured; the photons that get through the slit get through precisely because they have not hit anything on the way through. There can be no observer effect here because all the photos that are interfered with are absorbed, destroyed. Only unmolested ones pass.

See here for video demonstration: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8FTr2qMutA This is a neat demonstration because it is not hard to build and test in your own home.]]></description>
