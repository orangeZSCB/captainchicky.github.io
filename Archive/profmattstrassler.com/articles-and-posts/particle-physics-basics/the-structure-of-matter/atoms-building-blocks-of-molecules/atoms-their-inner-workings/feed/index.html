JohnChrysostom, the protons and neutrons aren&#039;t precisely at the nucleus either. They are also &quot;smeared out&quot;, but due to their much higher masses, in a lot smaller volume, so to speak. Note how the uncertainty principle includes mass - all else equal, a proton with the same &quot;uncertainty&quot; of position will have roughly 1800 times less &quot;uncertainty&quot; of momentum than an electron, which means the nucleus is a lot more compact than the atom. But that&#039;s electromagnetism, and electromagnetism has positive binding energy in the nucleus, not negative. To get the size of the nucleus, you need to deal with the strong force, which is a lot trickier. The naïve approach still works fairly well for hydrogen - with coupling constant equal to one (true enough at this distance) and mass 1800 times electron&#039;s, you get that the nucleus is roughly five orders of magnitude smaller than the atom, pretty close to reality. Mind you, I&#039;m no physicist, so take all this with huge grains of salt - I might be making some elementary mistakes. But the basic idea should be right - higher mass and stronger attraction means smaller &quot;uncertainty&quot;. Analogously to electron orbitals and shells, protons and neutrons in the nucleus also have their nuclear orbitals and shells. These are very important for nuclear physics, but don&#039;t really matter much to chemistry - from the point of view of the valence electrons, the nucleus might as well be a point charge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/#comment-41078&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

Elm, if you only consider the gravitational attraction between the planet and the star, the planet would also prefer to be spread out (even better, it would love to be at the centre of the other mass!). However, that&#039;s not enough - you also need a way to get rid of the extra energy and angular momentum. And that&#039;s where the differences between planets and electrons really jumps out at you. First, gravity is absurdly weak as a force, and it would take far longer than the current age of the universe for it to radiate away enough energy to do that even if you ignore the attraction between the individual particles making up the planet (both gravitational and electromagnetic).

Not ignoring that gives another important point - electrons are not composite particles, unlike planets. The individual particles making up a planet attract each other, and have negative binding energy - spreading the planet on its orbit (&quot;surface of an ellipsoid&quot; in the simple case) would lower the binding energy of the Earth-Sun system, but not the Earth-itself system. That&#039;s why planets formed from the cloud of debris in the first place - a ball of material has less energy than a dispersed cloud of material. Even with atoms with more than one electrons, there&#039;s a crucial difference - pushing electrons closer together requires energy (the electromagnetic interaction between them is repulsive, the binding energy is positive), while pushing two rocks together releases energy (the gravitational interaction between them is attractive, the binding energy is negative). So electrons *really* want to be as far from one another as possible (minimising their positive binding energies), while still keeping as close to the nucleus as possible (minimising their negative binding energy). Gravity seems to always attract, so bigger density is always better if you only consider gravity - the reason the Earth isn&#039;t denser is that the repulsive electromagnetic interaction prevents that - the result is a balance between the positive electromagnetic binding energies and the negative gravitational binding energies of the individual molecules.

Can the planet spiral *into* the Sun, then, and make a slightly bigger Sun-ball? Yes, but that requires it to get rid of the extra energy - and gravitational radiation isn&#039;t enough for that. In the Earth-Sun system, the power radiated away through gravitational waves is just ~200 W - compare this to Earth&#039;s kinetic energy (with respect to the Sun) of ~2.7E33. Ignoring all other effects and assuming the loss is constant (it isn&#039;t, but it&#039;s not all that important at age-of-universe-scales) would need about 4E23 years of gravitational radiation to get rid of that energy. There are examples of super-massive systems that do just that (still over large time scales) - two black holes closely orbiting each other and eventually merging together being probably the most obvious example (as LIGO has shown, the energy radiated away by gravity a few seconds before the merger is absurd, but it takes very short oscillations and large masses). That&#039;s not going to happen for a typical planet orbiting its star.

In contrast, the electromagnetic force is strong enough that the electron usually radiates the extra energy in a fraction of a second - so you mostly see atoms in ground states or just a bit excited (e.g. when a photon is absorbed by the electron bumping it slightly &quot;higher&quot; in the potential well but before the electron emits another photon (or more) as it &quot;drops&quot; again).]]></description>
