&quot;Now the problem is that what is really going on does not have any intuitive picture to go with it, and people interpret it differently. Should one say it is the electron that spreads out? Should one say that it is a wave that describes the electron that spreads out? Is it only the probability to find the electron that spreads out? None of these is really entirely accurate as far as it describes the equations we use, and we don’t know the equations are giving us quite the right picture for what nature is doing. &quot;
I think it best to take a &quot;Wittgenstein approach&quot; and just lay everything out as you have done in the extract above.]]></description>

To a non-scientist like myself, size is dependent on distance from whatever is being measured - a house looks smaller seen from a distance.  You have to get close to get the &quot;true&quot; size but there is a restriction on how close you can get so exact size is impossible to measure.  Not sure that helps !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot; “neutron as element zero”; I would say this is physically not an atom, because, lacking an electron, it is not in the same class as the other atoms. &quot;  A hydrogen ion doesn&#039;t have an electron but is still counted as a hydrogen atom ?  
I&#039;m an accountant and not a scientist so apologies if this is a nonsensical  comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A fascinating discussion is definitely worth comment.
I think that you should write more about this 
issue, it may not be a taboo matter but usually people 
don&#039;t speak about these topics. To the next!
Kind regards!!]]></description>
