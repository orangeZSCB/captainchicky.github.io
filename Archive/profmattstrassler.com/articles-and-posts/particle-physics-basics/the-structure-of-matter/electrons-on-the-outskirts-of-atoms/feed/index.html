					<description><![CDATA[This article was an enjoyable/informative read. I&#039;d been reading an article on &quot;mixed valence&quot; materials which mentions Â¿&quot;electrons changing mass&quot;? [ https://phys.org/news/2017-11-electrons-decades-old-mystery.html ]
Your article came up in a search trying to find out what that meant. Although you don&#039;t address it specifically, your thorough explanations of various properties of the electron filled in some critical gaps in my understanding.

I particularly appreciated that you started out with explaining why we can only say  electrons are &quot;apparently&quot; elementary particle AND reason for degree of confidence that they are. I&#039;ve found it frustrating when researching various physics subjects the prevalence (pre-valence, heh) of assertions of fact that when back-researched, turn out pretty open questions. Also, Spin bends your brain too. Yay!

So I&#039;d like to read
[How we know electrons exist: Coming Soon] &#038;,
[How we know electrons are indistinguishable and all have the same properties: Coming Soon]
any chance of it coming soon? :)

					<description><![CDATA[When explaining the &quot;contextual size&quot; of electrons to friends (when they ask about this stuff), I usually start with a question:  &quot;Where is a brick?&quot;  (It&#039;s a distributed object with a uniform PDF of detection over its volume.  You can assign it the coordinates of its COM, but then you have to explain why a brick wall has excluded volume -- the same problem you&#039;re approaching for atoms and molecules.  One should also tackle why a brick sitting on a table hovers half a brick-width above the table, but that&#039;s not the situation you&#039;re describing above.)  Then I add a magical insubstantial perfect position measuring machine: every time you push its button you get a valid infinite precision readout of the (more accurately, &quot;a&quot;) position of the brick.  If you get a stationary brick and push the button many times, you can get a realization of the PDF.  If you get a large population of the machines and point them at one brick, you can get the same thing.

Bricks aren&#039;t weird and neither is the (equilibrium) behaviour of electrons &quot;spreading&quot; throughout their local potential wells.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the helpful infoormation you supply on your articles.
I will bookmark your weblog and check again right here regularly.

I&#039;m slightly certain I&#039;ll be told many new stuff proper here!

Good luck ffor the following!]]></description>

They&#039;re really convincing and can definitely work. Nonetheless, the
