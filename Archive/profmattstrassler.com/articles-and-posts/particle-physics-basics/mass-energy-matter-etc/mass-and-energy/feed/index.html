					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Matt,

All very easy and straight forward, thanks.

The first question, and for me (Engineer - maybe the worst kind of hobbies), the physics seems to ignore internal energy (aka heat).  For me reading the words, momentum/movement seems to include the notion of vibrational energy, but it isn’t really followed through.

For example I started my search looking for how to create matter from energy.  The answer was adding two photons to make the Higgs particle, which sort of isn’t what I was looking for, because your starting with two particles.

Anyway this brought me through a link on another one of your pages to here.  Previously (probably on your other page), discussed of soft gamma particles and hard gamma particles (or similar).  The soft and hard seemed to me to embody higher or lower energy levels?

Anyway, if we go back to your example, happy to just look at Peters perspective, the Higgs particle at absolute zero (-273^C) or at 10,000^C has different Energy levels.  Conservation requires this to be true after conversion to 2 protons.  

I assume this thermal energy changes, (more thermal energy shortens) the wavelength of the emitted protons?  

My mind imagines that splitting anything exactly in half is “impossible” so one proton would/could have more energy than the other.  Conservation of momentum requires that of both particles travelled at the same speed =C then both are required to have the same mass.  Awesome, but light/photons have a wave nature and energy is stored in the wavelength.  

This however has the same issue, if the speed and mass is the same (discrete package), then the wavelength has to be the same.  In an explosion that breaks a particle in to two uneven peace’s the smaller particle simply travels faster to conserve momentum.  

One issues that arises is the vibrational momentum of internal energy.  At the atomic level we see particals literally vibrating.  At the instant the protons are emitted/created, was the Higgs particle in ossilation and therefore had physical momentum or was it stationary (as periodically required by ossilations)?  And if it is in motion is this conveyed to the proton packages?  Likely yes, and yes.  But is it easy to see which proton attracted the higher wavelength?  The proton emitted in the direction of the vibration, conservation of vibrational momentum or the photon emitted in the opposite direction? (Although I concede this vibrational movement is likely to resemble an electron cloud rather than polar (bi-directional) vibration and may indeed never be static.  Which also raises issues with the generations of Higgs particles and our ability to know and understand their nature.  Are they created and/or do they exist at a discrete internal energy level?  Do they, can they vibrate?  

The second question I have (and it is probably covered else on your site), momentum is p = mv

If mass = 0, P = 0,

Instead m(proton) = 1.67 x 10^(-27) kg 0

P = (gama) m v 
It looks like your using (gama) in your maths, but skirt around the issue by rearranging Einstein’s theory.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/#comment-8595&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

Hello Matt, 
Thank you for taking the time to write this piece. It has helped me greatly.
I would like to ask your opinion on a couple of definitions I have pondered on in an attempt to understand this subject from a background in electronics:
1. Could ENERGY be adequately defined as &#039;the capacity to induce change&quot; [in some parameter] and
2. Could a photon be defined as a carrier of &quot;evidence&quot; of such a change ?
Just to clarify (1):
Wherever there is energy, there is change (in velocity, temperature, momentum, brightness or voltage etc)
Conversely, wherever there is change, there is energy. Also, where there is no energy there is no change and where there is no change, there is no energy.
To clarify (2)
Is it not true that every photon has it&#039;s source in something (or some system) that exhibited a change of energy state (eg electron changing orbit, a decaying particle, collision etc) ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[PROPERTIES OF THE MATTER
Matter has the following fundamental properties:
First. It is indestructible, and exists in infinite quantity. For which the nothing has not existed, does not exist, and will never exist, and the laws of conservation are generated. The universal order comes from the immutable character of the properties of the primordial components of matter. 
Second. Matter is impenetrable at very short distances. It is and has its own space. At great distances the spaces of atoms are penetrable, being fields and overlapping, generating ordinary space, which is, as it is said, property of matter, and can not be empty, since it is itself matter.
Third. Matter is composed of atoms. The atomic components of Matter have energy or inertia, are heterogeneous with each other, and the character of heterogeneity is energetic or inertial, so they generate movement and opposition to it, the tendency to repose, universal, and Universal diversity.
Fourth. By virtue of their energy or inertia, the atoms of matter with energy and the atoms of matter with inertia are contradictory among them; they apply forces out of themselves and therefore become ponderable. These atoms are components of the so-called chemical elements.
Fifth. The atoms are associated with each other by their energy. Or by their inertia, that is, they integrate with each other those of the same essence, and by their association, of those who move, those of the dynamic essence, generate universal movement, Life, the universal process of evolutionary integration and universal diversity, and those of the static essence, which oppose life, generate gravity and inertia and try to stop progress by tending to rest, without respite.
Sixth. The existence and form of being of matter do not depend on whether any Being is observing it, that is, it exists by itself and is, and therefore has an objective character.
Seventh. It is knowable by itself being an integrated being. And, it reiterates, it generates the knowledge of itself, by itself.
Eighth. Its properties are immanent to it, that is, they constitute it, and were not created.
Ninth. Life is the property of dynamic matter. This property manifests as organic life when a dynamic entity reaches a certain level of evolutionary integration, that of algae, for example, in which the phenomenon of individuation appears for the first time in the history of the process of evolutionary integration. And much later, in due time, consciousness appears in the beings who reached the last level of evolutionary integration, achieved to date.
1/ The definition of atom that is used is: the atom as basic and indivisible block that composes the matter of the universe, that was postulated by the atomistic school in Ancient Greece, Century V A.C., being Democritus one of its exponents.
