					<description><![CDATA[Thanks very much for this.   In his book Quantum Space page 82, Baggott says &quot;In fact, elaborate QCD calculations demonstrate that about 95 percent of the mass of a proton or neutron is derived from the energy of massless gluons that carry the colour force between the quarks.... We see that Einstein&#039;s great insight was indeed that m=E/c2 the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content, and we conclude that mass is not something that an object has. Instead, the mass of an object is something that it does.&quot;    I had terrible understanding what was meant by &quot;something it does&quot; until I read your article.   As one of your amateurs, I really did not understand invariant mass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[More chaff than wheat on this thread and occasional name-calling (&#039;squirley&#039;). Objectors to relativistic mass should read: http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/mass.html and respond to the following passage which cites length contraction near the speed of light: &quot; There is no argument in the literature about the uses of rest length versus moving length, so why should there be any argument about the uses of rest mass versus moving mass?]]></description>
