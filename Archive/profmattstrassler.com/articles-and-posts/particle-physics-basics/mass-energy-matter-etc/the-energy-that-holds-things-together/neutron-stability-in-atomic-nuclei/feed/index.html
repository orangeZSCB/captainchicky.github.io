I love this answer! The real answer is that it has to do with the fact that the proton mass and neutron mass are so similar.  When the parent particle&#039;s rest mass and the &quot;children&quot; particles total rest mass are almost the same, the decay rate is very suppressed.  So you have to do a real calculation of the details to find out the answer. Similar issues explain why many radioactive nuclei have half-lives of years or millions of years.]]></description>

It’s simple, really. Just like neutrons obey Wolfgang Pauli  when inside the atom, so they obey Andy Warhol when they’re outside of it. Once their 15 minutes of fame are up, it’s all over for them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for everything on this site Matt.  I have one question.  Why 15 minutes for a neutron to decay?  It seems a strange time period, not extremely fast like many particles and not years like some atoms.  Is there a standard model calculation or explanation?  I&#039;ve looked throughout the site and haven&#039;t found the explanation.]]></description>

here is a very vague argument, that &#039;explains&#039; the difference in half-life : 

assuming that inside a nucleus there are anti-neutrons instead of neutrons and considerung a nucleus in the context of my &#039;hypotron theory&#039; mentioned above 
the hypotron configuration of Na-24 is : (107,104,52,37) , i.e. two prime numbers 107 and 37 do occur
and 
the hypotron configuration of Na-25 is : (111,112,56,39) , i.e. NO prime numbers occur 

this means that N-24 is qualitatively different from and N-25 
with respect to the hypotron configuration of the nucleus, 
i.e. the total numbers of low-plus-hypotrons and low-minus-hypotrons and high-plus-hypotrons and high-minus-hypotrons 

if one assumes that there is some intrinsic dynamics of the nucleus, 
then particular dynamical features might be depend (somehow) on the hypotron configuration of the nucleus,
i.e. if prime numbers are present then the nucleus has a large half-life 

in the same way one can argue in the context of the quark-model ( considering neutrons inside nucleus ) : 
Na-24 corresponds to 35 up-quarks + 37 down-quarks  ( 37 is prime )
Na-25 corresponds to 36 up-quarks + 39 down-quarks  ( no prime numbers ) 
i.e. half-life of Na-24 can be expected to be greater than half-life of Na-25]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My idea is that you will be frustrated if you have access to today scientific journals. Almost all papers deal with the BIG Bang, the Black Holes, the dark Matter and the Dark Energy in spite of the fact that Einstein refused to accept theese derivations from his theory. I suggest you to enter Academic Education whit my name for the last paper entiteled WHAT GRAVITY IS.
Coming bach to your question, open the first article in italian entiteled Il LEGAME NUCLEARE E IL PESO DEL NEUTRINO and to the table ecounting nuclear bonds.
If the energy of the nuclear bond is two anhilations and you compute thumber of bonds from the mass defect you will find that the number of bonds is equal to the non repated combinatins of protons an neutrons as Fermi suggests.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I came upon this article trying to find a reference on the possibility of the existence of vibrational states of the deuteron. A rather frustrating effort for retied person with limited accessibility to scientific journals. However I have a question regarding this article. Fine, the energetics an quantum fluctuation in energy prevent the decay of deuteron, but is there a modern version of an exchange mechanism by which the identity of proton and neutron interchange via say mesons exchange (or of up and down quarks) that could also account for the stable deuteron nucleus, or is this hopelessly old and discarded false idea?]]></description>
