This was the question I&#039;d been asking myself for the last few hours, even since you introduced a difference between real and &#039;virtual particles&#039;, only one of which seems to be nicely quantized and well-behaved.

These things seem described so differently, but it&#039;s hard to picture what keeps them separated when they share the same field and both seem to have some sort of wave-shape (?)

Could one not engineer a strong disturbance that happens to shape itself into an actual particle? Can I make a disturbance large enough that its peak reaches a quantum, can I then make it oscillate by some mechanism?

I can&#039;t see where nature draws the line.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a 2014, Helen Quinn (from SLAC) was recommending to use the expression &quot;interaction energy&quot; instead of &quot;potential energy&quot;  ( https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-05017-1_2 )
This expression does not seem to be used commonly -- and on this webpage, it seems to be &quot;self-invented&quot; term.
Is it possible to say a little about the &quot;origin&quot; or &quot;tradition of use&quot; for this expression &quot;interaction energy&quot;?]]></description>
