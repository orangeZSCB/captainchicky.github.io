Yes. For example, light behaves as a wave; single photons can pass through two slits (As in the famed Double Slit Experiment) yet light waves show no evidence of &#039;currents&#039; in some medium such as might be experienced by waves on the ocean. The best way we know of to explain this currently is to have light waves be excitations in a quantum field. (As opposed to a &#039;classical&#039; medium like &#039;aether&#039; which we have searched for and not found.)

The equations can get a bit finicky, but it&#039;s possible to write down a handful of them which explain WHY the universe does a lot of the things it does. (Such as all light traveling at the exact same speed despite having different energy content.) It&#039;s astounding what waves and fields can do. For example, the uncertainty principle becomes wonderfully obvious once you understand everything as waves, as opposed to just having to accept it as something that &#039;just is&#039;.]]></description>

Thanks a lot, Kudzu! You say that QFT is founded on the existence and mathematics of fields. This sentence really heats up my brain :-) So you are saying that we can explain real physical phenomena by imaging (= by postulating) quantum fields and this imagination of us can be wonderfully written down in equations, right?]]></description>

The existence of quantum fields is required for Quantum Field Theory tow work, in the same way that the existence of atoms is required for chemistry. The theory is founded on the existence and mathematics of fields. It is, of course, always possible that a better explanation can be found, but at present our best theory explains the universe in terms of fields and vibrations in those fields.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A fair question on vacua and vacuum fluctuations arises at event time zero of the big bang theory.  A vacuum fluctuation is said to have been the seed from which our universe was born.  A definition of vacuum as we know it and as discussed above is a region in space-time with fields for all of the elementary particles, most with value zero apparently except for the Higgs field and assuming that the field is a confined space, the temperature of the &quot;walls&quot; is absolute zero so that black body radiation (photon) does not emanate within the space.  At event time zero, there was no space-time, no fields of any kind whatsoever, and therefore no vacuum as we know it.  This is likely a philosophical question: how can a vacuum fluctuation have occurred in the absence of vacuum as we know it?  I think perhaps the correct terminology might be a void fluctuation since vacuum has a definition that is inconsistent with event time zero.  Void would need to be defined as a point surrounded by no fields whatsoever.]]></description>
