					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/cerenkov-radiation/#comment-75024&quot;&gt;E.Chaniotakis&lt;/a&gt;.

To follow up on those two great! questions from Rick. I am physics grad, but still Cerenkov effect is not that clear to me. 
1) If particle (with v&#062;c in the medium) losses energy to polarize the medium, and medium emits photons &quot;when switches this polarization off&quot;, why this &quot;de-excitation&quot; period is believed to be instantaneous? Say, fastest scintillators, which emit light in the process of de-excitation, still require nanosecond regime to work. What is so special that Cerenkov light emission mechanism takes no time?
2) Is this related to vacuum polatization? Can it then be explained with virtual particles of the vacuum or quantized fields &quot;between the particle and the medium&quot; ?
Thanks, 
Ron]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/cerenkov-radiation/#comment-1431&quot;&gt;Rick Ye&lt;/a&gt;.

Indeed, Rick, I think your reasoning #1  is correct, the external field created by the charged  particle polarizes the atoms of the dielectric medium and once the field disappears (that is, the particle is gone) the atom goes back to its original state by emitting light (photons). This process is happening independently of the particle&#039;s speed. In the case of a superluminal particle a constructive interference of all  the emitted  photons happens for a particular angle (the cherenkov angle) being the interference destructive for the rest of the angles (for an observer far from the origin of radiation) . In short, the energy lost by the particle is the same either it is superluminal or not. 

A plane when travelling through the air makes noise, not just during the sonic boom which  just sounds louder because of the constructive interference of the air waves. 

The radiator is the medium. Can the vacuum be polarized ? Well, in principle, yes, but that´s  another story.]]></description>
