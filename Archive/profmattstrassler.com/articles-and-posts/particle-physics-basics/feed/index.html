					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;What happens to force carrier particles when energy is transformed from one form into another?&lt;/strong&gt;

Thanks for asking me, but I try not to answer questions where I don&#039;t have a good understanding of the subject. So, I won&#039;t answer this question directly. This link may not answer your question, but it may help to give you a better idea of what a vir&#8230;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/#comment-76873&quot;&gt;Wayne C. Workman&lt;/a&gt;.

I am not a professor but I think I can answer that question. Yes, the electron will annihilate with the positron and not with the proton. This is because positrons and protons are positively charged and like charges repel. However, the resulting gamma rays don&#039;t necessarily collide with the proton unless it was very, very lucky (or unlucky, depending on how you like to view it). So yes, &quot;on occasion&quot; the proton will be affected by one of the two gamma rays but because the nucleus is tens of thousands of times smaller than the atom itself, so it is very unlikely to happen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just letting you know in case you are interested, there is a pseudoscience website bad-mouthing this blog. Here is the link:
http://science1.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/more-falsehoods-from-matt-strassler/
It is mainly filled with ad hominem attacks and a challenge to you from the author.
I can tell that this website is about pseudoscience because on the side, there is a link to another article from the same website that claims to &quot;debunk Newton&quot; just because of the existence of rogue planets.
If you have addressed website somewhere else, could you inform me about it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful blog! I found it while searching on Yahoo News.

Do you have any suggestions on how to get listed in Yahoo News?
I&#039;ve been trying for a while but I never seem to get there!
Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having read this I believed it was very informative. I appreciate you 
spending some time and effort to put this content together.
I once again find myself personally spending a lot of time both reading and leaving comments.
But so what, it was still worthwhile!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,  About a year ago I wrote asking what happens when a positron encounters a neutron.  Your answer confirmed my preconceived notion: nothing out of the ordinary.  Here I am asking what happens when a positron encounters a hydrogen atom consisting of the two matter particles - a proton and an electron.  Will this too be an unremarkable encounter or might, on occasion, the positron annihilate the orbital electron leaving, the proton to speed off in a direction very nearly opposite to that of the 1.02 MeV gamma ray?]]></description>
