					<description><![CDATA[Kudzu, not likely.
In general, the QED cross section (photon interaction probability in this case) scales as 1/s, where s is the center of mass energy. Thus, in the lab frame it scales as 1/E , E being the photon energy.
On the contrary, the neutrino interaction cross section is proportional to E until ~50 TeV (E being the neutrino energy).
and then goes logaritmically.
The intuition we have from &#039;&#039;everyday life&#039;&#039; comes from QED, therefore it&#039;s hard to explain neutrino behaviour.
I cannot find for the moment a useful analogy to the neutrino interaction with energy.. If I do I shall post it:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting. You state that lower energy neutrinos are less likely to interact with matter. This seems slightly odd to me since I am aware HIGH energy photons pass easily through matter that is opaque to visible light.There&#039;s also the matter of various electronic and nuclear transitions that make various substances transparent or opaque to various energies of photons. Do neutrinos experience this (albeit much weaker)? Is there such a thing as a &#039;neutrino mirror&#039; that can occasionally reflect a neutrino? Do neutrino beams diffract even slightly when passing through normal matter?]]></description>
