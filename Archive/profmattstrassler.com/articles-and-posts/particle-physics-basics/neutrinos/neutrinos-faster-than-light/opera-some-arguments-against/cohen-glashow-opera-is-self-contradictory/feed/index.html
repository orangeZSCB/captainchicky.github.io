					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/cohen-glashow-opera-is-self-contradictory/#comment-2586&quot;&gt;Hannu&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, that&#039;s a little ambiguously stated.  The four-momentum of the Z would only be known if the electron-positron pair were measured.  But if they aren&#039;t measured, then the four-momentum isn&#039;t known.  

But if where you are headed is to see if the velocity of the Z is faster than light, you can stop that line of thinking with this observation: when virtual photons are exchanged between two electrons that bounce elastically off each other, the velocity of those virtual photons is --- if you calculate it the way you&#039;re trying to do it --- infinite.  (Momentum is exchanged; energy is not; so v = p/E = infinite.)  Of course that&#039;s the point: virtual photons aren&#039;t particles, and if you start to think about them that way you will get into trouble.  See my post on virtual particles: https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff, Matt. I have two questions:  First, the relevant Feynman diagram here is neutrino emitting a virtual (time-like) Z which then decays into e+e-, right?  Second, since the Z is virtual, it doesn&#039;t have a well-defined velocity even if it&#039;s four-momentum was fully known, right?]]></description>
