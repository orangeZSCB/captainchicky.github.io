					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/opera-vs-icarus/#comment-2535&quot;&gt;Maryann kusin&lt;/a&gt;.

Well -- hmm -- measuring times in billionths of a second is fairly routine with modern electronics.  Any of Intel&#039;s chips, for example, does calculations a little bit faster than once every billionth of a second (one gigahertz frequency, or equivalently once a nanosecond).  100 picosecond timing (0.1 nanosecond) is not that unusual, and 10 picosecond timing is just beyond the state of the art in particle detectors.  The electronic signals moving around in the LHC detectors have to be synchronized to somewhere between a few nanoseconds to better than a nanosecond.  A proton-proton collision occurs in each LHC experiment every 50 nanoseconds (and the machine was designed to operate eventually with 25 nanoseconds between collisions).  So this isn&#039;t the hard part of OPERA.

Now if you want a layperson-friendly and accessible account of how nanosecond timing is actually done, I&#039;m not the right guy to provide it.  One of my experimental colleagues who teaches electronics would give a much better answer.  Readers who know how to explain this properly are welcome to answer, or to suggest a suitable website.

My (imperfect!) understanding is that the real challenge with the timing at OPERA is making sure all possible time delays as signals move down wires are properly accounted for.  They also have to ensure that the clocks at CERN and OPERA are synchronized to sufficient accuracy, but they use two independent methods (GPS timing, and atomic clocks moved from one lab to the other) that give the same answer.  Finally of course one needs to account for any subtle effects of relativity.]]></description>
