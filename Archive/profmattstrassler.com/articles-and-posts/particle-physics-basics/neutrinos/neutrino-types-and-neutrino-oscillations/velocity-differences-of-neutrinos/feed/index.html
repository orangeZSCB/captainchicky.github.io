					<description><![CDATA[You seem to be trying to account for a 10 second spread in the arrival time of Neutrinos from SN 1987A. Frankly the the maths is beyond me, but you seem to be assuming that all the neutrinos were created in an instant, which considering what follows is a fallacy... &quot;When the mass of the inert core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.4 M☉, electron degeneracy alone is no longer sufficient to counter gravity and maintain stellar equilibrium. A cataclysmic implosion takes place within seconds, in which the outer core reaches an inward velocity of up to 23% of the speed of light and the inner core reaches temperatures of up to 100 billion kelvin. Neutrons and neutrinos are formed via reversed beta-decay, releasing about 10 to the power of 46 joules (100 foes) in a ten-second burst.&quot;....Note; 10 second burst, &#038; not my work. I think you have your answer, but possibly not the one you were looking for.]]></description>

lepton flavor is not a conserved quantity -- unlike, say, angular momentum or electric charge.  So I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re asking.

&lt;em&gt;&quot; Standard Model would make more sense with one charged lepton (three possible masses) and one neutrino.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

It might make more sense to you, but it wouldn&#039;t agree with data.  There are three charged leptons; you can check this in many ways, the simplest of which to describe, perhaps, is the measurement of the Z and W particle lifetimes, which would be shorter than predicted and measured if there were only one charged lepton.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt: Neutrino oscillation between flavors is a neat trick, but what is lepton flavor? Lepton flavor describes what, muon-ness? The only known difference between electron and muon is the rest-mass.  Standard Model would make more sense with one charged lepton (three possible masses) and one neutrino. Neutrinos don&#039;t need flavor to interact with a particle, just the right energy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, isn&#039;t it possible that neutrini have zero mass-energy, travel at exactly c? That they are not ultra-relativistic particles, but pure signals, like photons? No mass-energy, only frequency-energy?]]></description>
