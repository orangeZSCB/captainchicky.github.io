					<description><![CDATA[This is a great and super helpful article although I am admittedly about a decade late to the game so I have no clue if you will see this. Anywho, I&#039;m writing about virtual particles for a non-scientific essay and wanted to check the correctness of my definition. Seeing as I don&#039;t know anyone with knowledge of quantum science irl, this seemed like an okay resort. It&#039;s meant to be incredibly basic, really just enough for it to be not inherently incorrect.
&quot;Quantum physicists discovered anomalies in the ripple of particles within their field. The disturbance causes such intense ripples that the particles will sometimes dip into other surrounding fields. At first glance, it appears that these particles are popping in and out of existence when in truth they are colliding with different regions of reality - this disturbance is referred to as virtual particles.&quot;
Thanks! I&#039;ll take any help I can get]]></description>
