					<description><![CDATA[Matt, I think it is very valuable that you keep rephrasing (re: waves) &quot;This is amazing. I mean, really: amazing, profound, and crucial to everything in our universe, including you.&quot; I keep thinking that a wave/field requires a physical medium. I think it does most of the time, but its important to realize that physicists might have a hard time with that too. In Grigory&#039;s description of a rope whose molecules are tugging at their neighbors, that physical analogy, while a good starting point, fools me in to thinking that a wave always requires elements of a medium to move. But it&#039;s such a good analogy! Air pressure waves are a good analogy too. The comparison to an oscillator requires an equilibrium and I&#039;m asking if there is an analogy that doesn&#039;t require the movement of physical particles (as if your job isn&#039;t hard enough!).

The ball-on-spring analogy says that potential and kinetic energy keep shifting back and forth. Because energy is conserved, this would oscillate forever with no degradation. The rope wave analogy says that the energy is moving along the wave without degradation too. Macroscopically, we know a force is needed to move a mass across a distance. So is it incredibly amazing that a wave can propagate energy through space without degradation? It would seem some energy is needed to perform the propagation. Can you explain why not?

In the rope analogy, assume both ends are tied to a tree. When you pull the rope up to snap it, the point you&#039;re pulling requires energy to displace from equilibrium. But all the points from that pulled point to an equilibrium requires some energy too. Consider a steel cable vs a rope. The same displacement requires different amounts of energy. So it would seem each kind of field has a different &quot;tension&quot; that determines what amplitude occurs for the same energy input. Since the energy propagates without energy loss, it would not matter when two fields intersect what the amplitude of the waves are, just the energy. Is this true, or would the amplitude of the wave in the field have other affects?]]></description>

I&#039;m sorry, I wasn&#039;t clear enough. Of course I do not need the rope to predict how it behaves, that kind of simple everyday sort of intuition is shared by most. It is the flow of your explanation, which attracts me most, and which was broken here. And the meaning of words, of course. Forgive me, if i&#039;m sort of wasting your time, but it&#039;s part of my job to create unbroken convincing explanations, and that is why I&#039;m trying to figure all that out.

So, we had a ball on a spring. We tried to push it and saw it had started (due to the forces of the spring) going back and forth. It became an oscillator: it started oscillating over time, that means it&#039;s position *repeated periodically* over time. We could have even noticed its position formed a cosine curve, it gave us an insight on the answer, but only an insight. We asked ourselves why it behaved like that, written down the equations of forces and obtained a solution, which indeed was a cosine. 
Now we have a rope: the whole collection of molecules, with adjacent ones being connected to each other with intermolecular forces. We tried to push it and saw:
1) Specific points started going up and down: their height positions repeated over time (just as if it was a small ball from the first example);
2) Heights of points repeated over space: that&#039;s a second repeation involved, though no point of the rope indeed oscillates along the rope (moves back and forth along the rope as ball on a spring).
Thus every point oscillates only up and down, and the heights of all the molecules of the rope *repeat both over time and across space*. That is where the term &quot;double oscillation&quot; doesn&#039;t really fit the everyday intuition: A naive understanding of oscillation is something going back and forth.
The question is: how we can produce the equation for a rope, just as we have produced them for a ball? The following intuition may help: every point on the rope tugs its neighbors. The force on some point of a rope depends on relative positions of adjacent points. Thus how fast the point oscillates over time depends on its current position and on how strong its neighbors pull it: d2Z/dt2 ~ Co * Z + Cx * d2Z/dx2. Or the other way round: How strong the point pulls its neighbors depends on its position and on how fast it moves itself: d2Z/dx2 ~ Co * Z + Ct * d2Z/dt2.
Then we may try to solve these equations and draw the cosine of both time and distance formula and indeed it will fit wat we observe on our rope.
Is that a more or less correct understanding?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/waves-classical-form/#comment-37729&quot;&gt;Grigory Makeev&lt;/a&gt;.

Ok -- I see various points of confusion here.  If your intuition is letting you down here, buy a &quot;Slinky&quot; or a long piece of string, and try this yourself!!  It will help you build your intuition to see real physical materials acting as I have described.

What is doing the oscillating?  As you say, it is the ball in one case, and the specific locations of the rope in the other.  I probably misspoke to say it was the &quot;wave&quot;, but I need to reread the article carefully to see if I did this poorly.  In the end, it is the wave we are interested in, not the rope.  Because it is the wave that will travel across the room, carrying information and energy --- not the rope, which in the end did not go anywhere.

Regarding the term &quot;double oscillator&quot;: as the wave moves along the rope, a given point on the rope goes up and down --- oscillating, just like the ball on the spring.  Is this not clear from Figure 5?  You can see that there is oscillation across time by watching a particular point on the rope as it goes up and down --- and you can see there is oscillation across space by looking at the shape of the rope at any given moment.  This oscillation in both time and space is what makes it &quot;double&quot;.

Now, what is the rope doing? and what is the wave doing?  Notice they are two different things.  The wave is moving sideways as well as up and down.  The rope is only moving up and down.  This is the truly fascinating part about waves!  If we look only at one point on the rope, it appears to be just like the ball on a spring.  If we look across the rope, however, we see its shape is also oscillatory --- which is something beyond the ball-and-spring example.

You asked: what determines where the wave goes?  The answer is that it depends how it was started. If you wiggle the left hand edge of the rope, the wave can only move to the right -- there isn&#039;t any rope to the left.  If you wiggle the right-hand edge, the wave will move to the left.  But if you wiggle the middle of the rope  a wave will move in both directions!  More generally, a light bulb will send light in all directions, unless you place it against an opaque wall.  A flashlight sends out light in a beam, but that&#039;s because all other directions are blocked off by opaque material and mirrors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear prof. Strassler!  Thank you very much for your work! I&#039;ve just found this site, and feel inspired by the new brush strokes in the picture of the world it gives :). However, I can not catch this particular article, and it leaves me distressed :).
The example with a bouncing ball was straightforward: we took an intuitive physical process, we examined the forces which influenced the ball, and recovered the equation that describes the position of the ball. Thus we got the _process_ we called an &#039;oscillating motion&#039;, the ball we called &#039;oscillator&#039;.
This article started with another intuitive example: a stretched rope and another physical process which starts with shaking one rope end. And there my personal intuition broke. Instead of finding out what and why would happen to a rope, we just stated that the _wave_ (not the rope! as with the ball!) is a &#039;double oscillator&#039;: the term that evades me. The term &#039;oscillating both in time and in space&#039; also misled my understanding: oscillation of the ball ment it repeated the position over time.
What _is_ a wave altogether? How and why does the wave &#039;move&#039;, if it does altogether? The wave on the rope is bound to move along the rope axis, what about the wave (a wavelet? a single ripple?) of a single photon? Shall it move in a single direction (where sent), or in all directions, as ripples on the water surface?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not see how the football stadium analogy can provide answers to the required conditions for a (physics) wave to propagate. A human wave can be produced with transmission of information (energy) or without (in case each person moves up and down periodically without communicating with each other). When with transmission, it occurs because each person can influence the next (by voice, sight, or touch etc.) but it does not say how/why each person can influence/transmit anything to the next one:i.e. how all the fundamental forces can influence anything at a distance (or how energy(wave) can propagate from point A to B). It feels magical yet real and ordinary like the conservation of energy. I can see/feel(observe) it happen but that&#039;s about it for now. I do not know how nature/universe keeps track of energy/charge or (how all the conserved quantities are (or not) connected or emerge) etc. it just happens. but does not necessarily mean that is the end of the story (for example, the exact connection between mass and energy was not clear until Einstein revealed it.). BTW, when you say &quot;a lattice&quot; are you talking about something like a lattice made of atoms? Or a lattice is like those crystal models:each ball connected with rigid sticks to the next balls repeating the same pattern in 3D? But a lattice (model) is continuous in the sense that the frame(?)/bone is connected (as one piece), is it not?

And, about &quot;physical wave&quot; and &quot;energy&quot;: Assuming a &quot;probability wave&quot; is a physical wave, does it carry energy?]]></description>

Mathematically, all a wave really requires is that there be something approximately continuous (absolutely continuous isn&#039;t necessary --- a lattice will do) and roughly uniform, arranged so that activity in one location induces a similar activity in nearby locations.

The best way to understand this is intuitive.  Think about a &quot;wave&quot; at a football stadium; what is required for it to propagate around the stadium?  A roughly uniform and approximately continuous distribution of spectators; the ability of each spectator to respond to the actions of the spectator next to him or her; and someone to get the whole thing started.  And that&#039;s about it.

Any physical wave carries energy.  All changes of any sort, in nature, require energy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What are the (minimum?) &quot;required&quot; conditions/properties for &quot;a wave&quot; to propagate (or exist) in the universe? When I imagine &quot;a wave&quot; to propagate, it must at least be able to change/affect/influence its immediate neighbor&#039;s condition (something that is right next to it), and this in turn changes another neighbor&#039;s, and so on. My question is:for &quot;a wave&quot; to propagate, does its field (Z(x,t)) or medium have to be smooth and &quot;continuous&quot; (or can be discontinuous)? If so, why is it a required condition? (a field is not a medium but I must admit when I think about how a wave propagates I imagine something more like a medium with some kind of internal structure) It seems even if each local entity (a constituent of the medium?) is not connected to the next one, a wave can still propagates if a constituent can bump into (or interact only at a certain distance with?) the next constituent. If we assume its field (or medium) is continuous(or discontinuous), what kind of theoretical or observational inconsistency does it create or solve? (or maybe neither creates inconsistency?)
Another question:does any type of (propagating or non-propagating) wave always carry energy? or some waves could exist without energy (or with zero energy?)?]]></description>
