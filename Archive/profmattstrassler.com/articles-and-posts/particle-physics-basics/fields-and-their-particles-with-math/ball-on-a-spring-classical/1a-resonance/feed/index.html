					<description><![CDATA[One time while in a California redwood forest I came across a giant redwood tree that had fallen over. There was about 50 or so feet of it that had no supports under it and was free to move, but moving that much tree with just my body strength alone wasn&#039;t a real possibility, but I knew that I could introduce a resonance by grabbing a branch and slowly moving that branch to whatever that natural frequency that the free part of the tree had. Each time the tree sprung up a little I added a pull on the down motion. After doing this about 10 times I had that giant tree oscillating quite far, much farther than I could have moved it in any one single attempt. By leveraging a little bit of energy over multiple cycles on something with a natural frequency something was created ( a new level of motion and if applied to do work...) that wouldn&#039;t have been there before.

Professor, I think this is what it is that you are talking about.]]></description>
