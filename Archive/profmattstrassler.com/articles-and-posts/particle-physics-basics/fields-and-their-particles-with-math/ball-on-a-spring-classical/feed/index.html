					<description><![CDATA[I am a science graduate, in fact MSc. But I graduated in 1955. Did not work on the field, but I never lost my love for it. Now I am retired, and had other changes in my life. Decided to follow up on what happened during my lost time. It is not easy, but your article is like fresh air. Simple, easy to follow and to understand. You have no idea how much it means to me, and how thankful I am.Well, I briefly explain. I lost my husband (dyed) a few months ago. I lived for him, and I need to fill the vacuum. That is why want to follow up on news in the world of physics.But your simplicity and very logical step by step presentation is hard to come by. Thank you very, very much.

					<description><![CDATA[Matt
I am having trouble with this part of your math: All we need to do is first calculate the particle’s velocity as the change in time of its position:

d/dt (z₀ + A cos[ 2 π ν t ]) = - (2 π ν) A sin[ 2 π ν t ]

If z is short hand for z(t) and z(t)=z₀+Acos[2πvt] then shouldn&#039;t the particles velocity be written as dz(t)/dt, which becomes, dz₀+[2πvt]/dt?  It appears to me that the numerator and denominator are reversed and that there is a missing term for time, t.  Please forgive me if I am missing something here.  And thank you for bearing with me as I attempt to deepen my understanding.  Or this all may just be a misunderstanding caused by the way the equations look on the page, which make it appears as if (z₀ + A cos[ 2 π ν t ]) is in the numerator.  If that is the case I am sorry to have bothered you.
