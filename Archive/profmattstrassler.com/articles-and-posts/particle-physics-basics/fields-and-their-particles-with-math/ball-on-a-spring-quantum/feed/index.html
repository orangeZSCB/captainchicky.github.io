					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t it known that things are quantized because electron orbitals require an integer number of de Broglie waves, thus the photons they&#039;re capable of emitting (absorbing) on orbital descent (ascent) are quantized, thus the energy of those photons is quantized, thus the zero point energy field primarily contains that entropied energy of wavelengths corresponding to those energies of those photons emitted?

Had symmetry breaking of the Unified force into gravity and the electronuclear force, which symmetry broke into the strong and electroweak forces, which symmetry broke into the weak and EM forces never taken place, then energy wouldn&#039;t be quantized, as composite particles would never have formed.

The non-quantized energy from prior to this symmetry breaking must still exist, but because electron orbitals can only absorb in quanta, it never gets utilized via vacuum polarization to sustain electron orbit (reference Boyer et. al., 1975) unless it red-shifts due to universal expansion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/ball-on-a-spring-quantum/#comment-18243&quot;&gt;Brent Jackson&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m new to this blog ... very appreciated. B. Jackson&#039;s comment seems important. I notice in this blog M. Strassler often pointing out science follows where observation leads and is an effort to &quot;explain&quot; reality largely in a pragmatic sense of being able to pre and post dict observation and how nature works. This can seem inadequate to those with a habit or desire for &quot;ultimate&quot; answers to the Why question, but seems perfectly adequate and satisfactory to those who view the Why question as more of a &quot;How&quot; question and a request for evidence and process. If this latter became more often the expectation for the Why question then science would make more sense to lay people. And parents give better answers too. :{)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since E = (n + 1/2)h{nu}, then as you stated, it takes h{nu} to increase the quanta of an oscillator. So a 1Hz oscillator takes 6.6*10^34 J/s to increase 1 quantum. An oscillator of .999Hz would then take 6.5934*10-34 J/s to increase 1 quantum. The energy is quantized but the frequency doesn&#039;t appear to be. So for any given oscillating system its energy increases by h{nu} but there is a continuous spectrum of frequencies available? If so, then with no lowest quantized frequency there would be no lowest quantized energy increment?]]></description>

In this spirit perhaps an historical response would be adequate ? Along the lines of :  starting more or less with Newton, physicists built a view of the world where physical quantities can take on any value, have a well defined value at all times, can be measured with arbitrary precision (in principle), etc. It was a mechanistic view and philosophically suspect at first, but this worked so well for a while that it became accepted and the weirdness was mostly forgotten. But over time, with the study of electromagnetism in particular, phenomena started to appear that couldn&#039;t be explained well this way, and hints of a fundamental discreteness in nature appeared. So physicists started trying stuff like &quot;Well, let&#039;s assume this discreteness is real. Let&#039;s posit that the energy levels of this system can only take discrete values. What then ? And with clever analysis they started getting answers that worked. Up to the point that a full blown theory emerged, one were all three assumptions above are unqualifiedly false.
The problem with this is it&#039;s no clear to me what examples could be used. Perhaps the hydrogen spectrum ? 
Anyway, sorry for the long digression, I just found your website and I think it&#039;s a gem. Your pages about the Higgs or QFT make it all seem so clear and natural, quite a feat for such subjects. So thanks !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A motivating discussion is definitfely worth comment. There&#039;s no dolubt that that you need to 
write more on this topic, iit may not be a taboo matter but generally folks don&#039;t speak about such topics.

To the next! All the best!!]]></description>
