					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/waves-classical-equation-of-motion/#comment-410941&quot;&gt;Tim Preece&lt;/a&gt;.

In fact I think I could now give a hand waving explanation to my friends of how the higgs field gives rise to mass. The base of the mattress being the higgs field, the surface being the particle field, the springs being the interaction, the fact that in the limit of long wavelength there is still an irreducible frequency of vibration due to the springs, and so an irreducible quantum of energy/mass even for a stationary particle. ( or something along those lines )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
Just re-reading this group are articles. They are fantastic and would make a great book. 

I was just trying to get a simple intuition for class 0 and class 1 waves. I can imagine with class 0 waves that the rope just wants to be straight and so it changes in proportion to how curved the rope is at a particular point. Thinking about class 1 waves it seems like the rope would also have little springs attached at every point. 

Would a lightly sprung mattress exhibit class 1 waves ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having read this I believed it was really informative.

I appreciate you spending some time and energy to put this article together.

I once again find myself personally spending a significant 
amount of time both reading and leaving comments. But 
so what, it was still worth it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t think of a common Type 1 example either, but I think one could be made.

Start with a Shive wave machine (like the one shown here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUohelhrtl8), but add a weak spring from each bar to the table (set so that the spring is unextended when the bar is horizontal).

Now the ν=μ case is simply the whole machine twisting in unison against the new springs, without ever putting any torsion into the central wire. The ν≅c/λ case is when the wavelength is sufficiently short that the torsion in the central wire completely dominates over the new springs.]]></description>
