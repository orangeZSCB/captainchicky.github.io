					<description><![CDATA[Prof Strassler, over the course of some years, I&#039;ve enjoyed delving into these pages. Thank you for your effort in creating and maintaining them. I am at a loss to understand exactly how the smallest components of the material world could possibly be ripples in a complex valued probability amplitude vector (or spinor or..) field. To me, this sounds like reifying Ptolmiac epicycles because he was somewhat succesful at predicting planetary positions. Can you help with my difficulty? How can we every move from the epistemic theory to a description of reality,  merely a description of how it operates, to what it is, ontically?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Space, and the CMB that fills it, is the &quot;Either&quot;. Standing waves in the CMB are the primary nodes that form matter. A standing wave is a density and we get time dilation as densities slow the evolution of space by time. We then get gravity, which is the evolution of events down the time dilation gradient. This translates the &quot;fundamental&quot; force of time, which is irresistibly evolving all events in space forward in the forward direction of time, into inertial energy. In spherical dilation pits, the gravitational direction of evolution impedes on itself from all directions at the focus of the pit and the kinetic energy is translated into thermal energy due to pressure, and the forward direction of evolution spins off into &quot;opposite directions&quot; giving us Up Quarks and Electrons, which give us protons, Hydrogen and Helium and, under pressure, these are forced together to create all the other elements. This is a self perpetuating process.

However, these are all just probablistic particle events as it is always just an evolving energy field that is observer dependent. It begins with a &quot;perception&quot; of time dilation.  We can &quot;understand&quot; how it is manifested, but we are only studying how it manifests &quot;when we study it&quot;. That is so we can play with it. We are not seeing what is actually happening. The particle events continually evolve forward for each of us, at the center of our own universes, to manifest our individual, harmonized, worlds, but we don&#039;t see that when we study it.

And it all just manifested out of time evolving space forward.]]></description>

The two observers have harmonized points of view as they travel towards each other and see the other&#039;s effects as opposite theirs. You are supposing the two become one at some point, a single observer, experiencing both worlds simultaneously. If they were traveling along wires right next to each other, as they would have to be, the adjacent fields make perfect sense. If they were on the same wire, they would experience increasing resitance as they approached each other, the wire would get hotter and hotter and.......no can do.]]></description>

Please read this paper as it is very close to what you are talking about. Then we can discuss it further if it is OK with the Professor. I don&#039;t want to hijack his site. An earlier version of this paper was peer reviewed and published in the Journal of Cosmology, Vol. 26, #21. This is the latest version:  https://www.journalofmoderncosmology.com/General%20Relativity%20and%20Effects%20in%20Time%20as%20Causation.pdf]]></description>

It is also a dielectric so that a spinning volume become less permeable and yet the forms in this dielectric can create charge through casimir effect]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The mathematics of relativity ensures that no preferred reference frame exists for experimental measurements.  But this doesn’t logically preclude a physical field medium, it only really precludes a fundamentally classical one.

If you’ll indulge a brief analogy with superfluidity or superconductivity; the mathematics there says there can be two fluids coexisting at once with separate overlapping currents and flow fields, something classical fluids can’t do.  I’d say ponderable media can’t do this either. 

And now, stretching this superfluidity analogy past it’s breaking point, space being stationary for all inertial frames might be something akin to saying that the old Ether is actually a kind of quantum fluid that couples it’s fluctuations to its observers in different ways depending on their reference frames; to the extent that observers in different frames see different “instances” of a single overall space and time.

This is not a new idea even in the classical realm. The very magnetic field of Maxwell is like this.  If you travel along a charged wire holding a compass, you’ll observe a current below you and a therefore a magnetic field surrounding the wire, with field lines in a certain left-right transverse orientation.  If your experimental partner is heading toward you along the same wire, there will be moment where their compass needle, coincident in space and time with yours exactly, shows an opposite field.  Should we conclude from this that magnetic fields aren’t real and only electric fields are real?  (If you take up this position, I can construct a real physical apparatus that displays equally “unreal” conflicting electric fields for two observers moving along the pole of a long liner magnet, no magnetic monopoles required.)

Thoughts?]]></description>
