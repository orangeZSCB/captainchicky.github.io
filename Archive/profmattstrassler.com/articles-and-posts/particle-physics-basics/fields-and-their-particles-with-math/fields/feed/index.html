daniel, let people know What doesn&#039;t make sense or is contradictory. If it says A==B, and later, B==C, then concludes with A!=C, then point out that error. I don&#039;t know Lots and Lots of these things, but the site does a good job of trying to explain. I &quot;really&quot; love it when the text says &quot;And the following is an analogy, but don&#039;t take it verbatim, because there&#039;s a lot of assumptions&quot;. That clues me in that there are details missing, so I can go look for them. So, try to point out specific problems, and people will try to address them. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard about a particle called a &quot;phonon&quot;, which is supposed to be the force carrier of sound waves. I don&#039;t get how one could exist, since from the science I know, sound waves are the result of compressions and rarefications (sorry if I misspelled these) in a material, like air. So, does that mean everything&#039;s a phonon? If not, what is it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading your article and am commenting on Fig 2. To understand it, I copied a snapshot of the animation and add the image of the lattice at equilibrium underneath. This way I can see the dots displaced from equilibrium. Drawing a line from the equilibrium dot to the displaced counterpart, I can &quot;see&quot; that a positive D(x,t) is due to the dot displaced forward and a negative D(x,t) is a dot displaced backward. I have an image of this construction, but can&#039;t find a way to give it to you. Thank you - this is all more understandable than any other course&#039;s explanations. Most important are the disclaimers so that I don&#039;t take an analogy as a fact and get confused.]]></description>

My question was *not* about the wave function for the field strength that is the functional Î¨[Ï†(x,y,z)] in your comment above. I was wondering if there is such a thing like a probability density psi(x,y,z, ...) in QFT to &quot;find&quot; a (one, multiple) photon(s) at a given spot (x,y,z) and how it is related to the ripples in the electromagnetic field. My suggestion was that this is not provided as a basic entity by the formalism of QFT but that it needs to be calculated point by point by introducing a the coupling to another field B(x,y,z) that represents the detection mechanism. But I&#039;m just guessing here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/fields/#comment-19429&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

Could you please sketch a way how to relate a QFT field A(x,t) - that features localised ripples (particles) - to a probabilistic wave function presented in introductions into quantum mechanics? So, how do you calculate the probability that some apparatus would catch the photon at the place of the correspondent ripple in its field? 

Do I need to describe my apparatus (e.g. silver nitrate) by another field B(x,t) that is excited at the same area where my photon ripple passes through? Then in QFT, there might not exist such a thing like an independent space-time probability density for photons. Rather you would always need to introduce other fields that interact with the photon, in order to tell where they will manifest themselves in space-time with a probability that is calculated from the yAB terms on the following pages. Is my thinking correct?

Also, I assume that the local field ripples that represent photons in the following pages do not really have one exact frequency/energy since they vanish eventually (Heisenberg). So I suspect that these local ripples in space time represent some composite photon state that is only approximate to a perfect one-photon as defined by energy steps. Is my confusion justified here?]]></description>
