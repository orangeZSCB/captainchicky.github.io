					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Matt. I was wondering if you had any information on how invariant-mass matter excludes (at least partially) the quantum vacuum field modes longer than the radius of that invariant-mass matter (the effect which causes a gravity &#039;well&#039;, which causes time to slow down in a gravity &#039;well&#039;, and indeed the effect which underlies the stability of invariant-mass matter) via vacuum polarization? I&#039;m trying to wrap my brain around how fermions can exclude bosons, even if only partially. Is there an analogy to some physical process which would help in removing my brain-block?

Is it a similar concept to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, or is there another principle which explains this phenomenon besides SR?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for these articles! Feel like I&#039;m missing something blindingly obvious, or maybe this is what the last [bracketed] paragraph refers to… but if the number of quanta of oscillation in a wave is 0 [n=0], shouldn&#039;t that mean there is no wave? The formulas above, though, seem to suggest that a Class 0 wave with no quanta will still have energy equal to (1/2) h ν. Also that a Class 1 wave will actually have negative energy. 

Thanks again,]]></description>

To Dr. Strassler: Thank you for your interesting answers/explanations. 
You said &quot;This potential ambiguity of which one is which is the key to the story, and that’s why the interesting properties of bosons and of fermions are only important for two bosons of the same type and for two fermions of the same type.&quot; But why is this applicable to fermions and bosons of the same types but not to the identical ordinary objects like balls (assuming they have identical structures at atomic level and molecule by molecule)? because no matter how carefully made, an objects/system made of multiple fundamental particles cannot be exactly the same (cannot have exactly the same state)? or is it something to do with the size or mass of the object? Only fundamental particles (without internal/sub/ structure?) can (behave) be indistinguishably identical in physical phenomena? A proton has internal structure but is it always possible to distinguish proton A and B before/after their collision event etc.?

P.S. sometime ago, I read you would write articles on the current &quot;standard model (=partial grand unified theory(GUT)?)&quot; Are some of the articles already posted in this site? (if so, could you point the links.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/7-particles-are-quanta/7a-how-bosons-and-fermions-differ/#comment-51732&quot;&gt;el&lt;/a&gt;.

At some level, these are inevitably technical questions, for which math is necessary... but I&#039;ll do my best to answer non-technically.

To answer your last questions first: the Pauli principle (like the Bose-Einstein principle for bosons) is not due to a force, but rather &lt;em&gt;a consequence of the nature of the things themselves&lt;/em&gt;.  If you try to make a state with two electrons doing the same thing, you will find that state equals zero; it&#039;s not a state at all.  So no physical phenomenon can violate the Pauli principle; no amount of pressure and gravity can change it.

Why does it only impact fermions of the same type?  Analogy: If two waves of similar shape collide, and two waves emerge from the collision, did the two waves pass through each other or did they bounce off each other?  There&#039;s no way to tell.  When two identical particles collide, you cannot tell after the collision which one is which. 

Before   X --&#062;  &#060;-- X

After    &#060;-- X   X --&#062; 
    - - -        (which X is which???)

If the two particles were not identical to start with, you &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; tell the difference:

Before:  X --&#062; &#060;-- Y

After:  &#060;-- X   Y --&#062;    is different from   After: &#060;-- Y   X --&#062;  

This potential ambiguity of &lt;em&gt;which one is which&lt;/em&gt; is the key to the story, and that&#039;s why the interesting properties of bosons and of fermions are only important for two bosons of the same type and for two fermions of the same type.

All fundamental particles of nature are &lt;em&gt;(or, more precisely, &quot;are today described as&quot;)&lt;/em&gt; ripples in quantum fields.  And two ripples in the same field cannot be distinguished.  In a world with three or more space dimensions, there are two types of fields; ripples in boson fields (like photons) must be symmetrically related, whereas ripples in fermion fields must be antisymmetrically related.  No force is required to make this so; it is in the nature of the ripples. Since antisymmetrically related objects cannot be in the same place doing the same thing, the Pauli exclusion principle applies to them. 

Yes, this applies to up quarks, and separately, to down quarks.  In fact the Pauli exclusion principle helps explain why, even though there are protons with two up quarks and a down quark (plus many other things, see https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/) and there are neutrons with two down quarks and an up quark (plus many other things), there are no corresponding objects with three up quarks (plus many other things) or with three down quarks (plus many other things.)  Objects with three up quarks can be formed, but they require the up quarks be doing three different things, which requires more energy, which means in turn that they have larger masses and are unstable, decaying in about a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see. Thank you for your answer, Dr. Strassler. So, between an electron and a positron there is no effect (no repulsive &quot;nor attractive force&quot;?) whatsoever due to the Pauli exclusion principle? And, the Pauli exclusion principle applies between an up quark and an up quark but NOT between up and down quark etc.(does this mean the distance btw u&#038;u and u&#038;d quark inside a proton is different due to the Pauli exclusion principle?)? And, no physical phenomena can violate/overcome the Pauli exclusion principle? such as the pressure created by supernova/big bang or electrons fell into a black hole? Electrons inside a black hole still cannot occupy the same state/position even under the enormous(infinite?) pressure due to gravity? Electrons or the exactly the same fermions cannot be crushed nor put together(superimposed) even at the singularity(if this exists)?? First of all how does  the Pauli exclusion principle arises? why it only applies to &quot;fermions of exactly the same type&quot;? but not fermions of different types?]]></description>
