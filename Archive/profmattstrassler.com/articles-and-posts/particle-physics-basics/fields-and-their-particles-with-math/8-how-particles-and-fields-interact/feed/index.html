					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Strassler, thank you for everytihng, your page is brilliant. In case you still provide replies to older articles, I would like to ask a question about  fields and their meaning for causality.
The fields interact with each other and particle physics undestands every such interaction as &quot;bidirectional&quot; - it can happen both ways with the same probability. However, no change in entropy is involved and no arrow of time can be determined under such reduced scenario.  Once multiple particles are considered and the geometry of their &quot;placement&quot; in Spacetime (or the sum of information they express by the actual way They ARE in the universe) allows to deterrmine what was the course of interaction and which way the reaction went - allowing for entropy and time to make sense. The reality of the world includes (obviously) many particles. There are futher causal issues at play under such circumstances, namely the  &quot;spherical nature&quot; and an (unlimited) extent of gravity + electromagnetic fields associated with charged particles. These tend to shape our worlds rather significantly as causal factors. Is it so that objects of rather unchanging number of fermions (such as the Earth) are primarily shaped by ever changing infuences of gravity and electromagnetism (including influences from other objects, namely the Sun. So is there any value of the structure of the matter as far as fundamental laws of physics are concerned and are there any means of theoretical physics to dealing with such issues. Sorry for the layman&#039;s language. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the theme of causality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Arena of physics bast on a belief: simplicity being the law of the universe. But why should the fundament of the universe be simple? Because the observation too limited and test too partial. If this be a faket corner of a complex universe, the tendency will be wrong and the laws be local and phenomenon, like the pure linear field equation here.
And why should there be more laws than irregularity? Maybe only because the sample pool too small and neuronal evolution path force it to create continuously such a delusion, or the arena of physics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have some doubts on particles, fields interaction. My current understanding says that, fields(virtual particles related to the field) carry momentum of the source particle and interact with other particles..but what I don&#039;t understand is, when will the source particle lose this momentum that is carried by this virtual particle? is it like after sometime, if this virtual particle interacts with something, then instantaneously the source particle loses momentum? or even before when this virtual particle interacts with something else?
basically what happens to the particles kinetic energy when the field related particle is interacting with something else?

All in all, i don&#039;t quite understand how field manages momentum transfer, like when the particle k.e changes etc.

I may not have been clear above, would be great if these can be explained properly. i.e the field and particle interaction process, as close to reality. with a scenario like a 3 particle interaction or 2 particle interaction.

Thank you.]]></description>

Amplitude does come into it -- when he specifies a single quantum of A and a single quantum of B, that&#039;s a specification of amplitude.  If you go back to part 5, you&#039;ll recall amplitude is proportional to the square root of the quantum number (n).]]></description>
