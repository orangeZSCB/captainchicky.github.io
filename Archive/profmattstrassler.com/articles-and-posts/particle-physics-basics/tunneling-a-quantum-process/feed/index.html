					<description><![CDATA[This &quot;electron jump&quot; model looks similar to the random discontinuous motion approach of Shan Gao and others to me. If this is going to be a serious theory and not just an ad hoc apporach it should also reproduce the double slit experiment, so include the phase of the Schroedinger wave function. That would be interesting to see how interference could come out of this &quot;jump&quot; model. I was trying to find where Shan Gao has calculated this in his random jump model but could not find it so far. @Paul: I believe it&#039;s more the &quot;quantum jitter&quot; of the particle that causes the tunnel effect while the atoms that make up the bowls correspond to large objects by comparison and their fluctuations can be neglected.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Using the analogy of the bowls, could quantum tunneling be due to the quantum fluctuations of vacua ie &#039;the bowls&#039;?
So that the &#039;bowl&#039; jitters and change &#039;shape&#039; and location? In other words the minima is moving and changing location?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi - I need to explain this to a bunch of 17-18 year olds.  I think the analogy with the bowls is great and I will use it.  However, the question I am often asked is this:  we regularly get sparking with high enough potential differences - we only need to look at the Van de Graaf generator for this.  Why then don&#039;t electrons jump the gap in the STM in the same way that we get discharge in an air gap from a Van de Graaf generator?  In other words, what prevents an electron from classically jumping the air gap in an STM when we know that with a high enough voltage, we can generate an electric field that will ionize the air and allow a current to flow anyway?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just trying to grasp the concept. Which one is correct? Neither?
- The electron constantly moves. There&#039;s a radius/region with very high probability that the electron moves into, but theoretically, he can move anywhere, so you have a chance to find him in Alaska :P . Thus, tunneling is nothing more than a stray particle
- Tunneling is a form of teleportation, so if you could (i know it&#039;s impossible) follow a path of the electron, he disappears from x and instantly appears in y.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good afternoon, my name is Ayodeji IBITOYE a masters student of the University of Ibadan, Niogeria. In search for an head way in a research am doing presently i navigated my way into this place and quite appreciate the beauty of what you have done. Need help in my research. Currently working on my MSc thesis on relativistic quantum mechanics. From the solution of a single particle non-relativistic schrodinger equation for a finite potential well to a relativistic solution(Klein-Gordon), I thought of looking at how a particle trapped in a potential well can be liken to how photons gets trapped inside a shield used in protecting normal cells in radiotherapy....where the particle in a potential well is now the photons..Looking for the appropriate and suitable POTENTIAL to solve Klein-Gordon equation or how do i correctly go about this pls help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Professor.You are doing an awesome job. This was an awesome article.I am an MD but hugely interested in Physics. I want to self study it from scratch that is completely go through undergrad and grad physics courses. Can you please suggest books from where to start for undergraduate Physics? I am familiar with Mathematics and believe that I can grasp complicated mathematics though of course it will take time.
Thank you!]]></description>
