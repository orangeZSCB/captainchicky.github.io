					<description><![CDATA[I have always run away from maths! And in the end, to &quot;understand&quot; physics, one must be able to read maths.
I look at field equations, Einstein&#039;s equations (even Maxwell&#039;s equations) and not to mention Dirac, I see hieroglyphics. No meaning at all.
Is it too late and where/how would you suggest I start?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love your work. Well done! I too am a deep thinking scientist and I have tried to get to grips with Einstein’s relativity explanations many times. I still do not understand them and now aged 68 I have given up reading them. 
In your article on the information paradox, I feel it would have been helpful to know better what the information exactly is? I follow Penrose works and he seems to have developed a good descriptive approach that helps with understanding entropy.
However I am quite unable to accept the parallel universes theories, even if it’s might explain why gravity is so small compared to the other fundamental forces. Ken Trethewey, Cornwall, UK]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the things most amazing to me. other than the BB itself, is why are there so few elementary particles, With all that energy, the potential seems unlimited. Why just twenty something and not 250. or 2.500 or 250,000?  Long-term stability obviously plays a role, but is there more to it than that? Is this a question that anyone has tackled or even one that can be answered?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The different radius values may be due to the fact that the proton is not spherical. It could have six knobs. Four around the equator and one on each pole. I calculate its average radius to be
.841 235 636 fm. The circumference of a circle with that radius is exactly four wavelengths of a proton mass&#039;s photon.]]></description>
