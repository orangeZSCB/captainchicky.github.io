					<description><![CDATA[Hey Matt, I sincerely hope that you are doing well in this time of pandemic and pandemonium. I understand that you are no longer being paid for or expected to do outreach, but I hope you will continue to post if you find something interesting to talk about. Please at least post an update so that your fans know that you&#039;re OK.

Having scanned your comment sections; yeesh. So many sincere but poorly educated people. So many needy philosophers, certain their incoherent ToE is correct and, of course, some trolls as well. The percentage of uninteresting commentors may have increased markedly since you reduced your post frequency, but your readers still have great respect for you.

I was a regular OPS reader during the early years of the LHC and it was immensely useful to me (retired polymer chemist/IT professional) and many other people who&#039;s training in other fields let them easily follow your lucid explanations of the underlying physics. Thanks for that.

Since I hadn&#039;t checked in for a while I just read your June &#039;19 blog on the EHT image. Interesting. (I wonder if the periapsis advance of photons on elliptical orbits is the reason the photon region is not a photon sphere, i.e. they &quot;thicken&quot; the surface of the sphere?)

Point 2) in your final remarks bugs me. &quot;...the accretion disk can extend to...or inside of the photon region.&quot;
If you meant to say that it appears to do so from our view under the conditions you posit due to some relativistic lensing effect you did not make that clear. (This seems unreasonable to me since we are viewing both in the same narrow RF band, so they should be lensed similarly.)
If you meant that the inner edge of the accretion disk is physically inside the photon ring/region, huh??  Wouldn&#039;t the inner edge of the photon ring/region consist of the innermost stable orbits of massless photons? Doesn&#039;t basic orbital mechanics apply? A stable orbit of smaller radius would surely have to be superluminal.

Thoughts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Respected Sir, 

I hope you are fine and healthy.I am Harshit, a student from India and I want to tell you that I have done some research in physics which focuses on some of the unanswered questions about our universe and sir it is my humble request to you to please see my work on a zoom meeting which just take 5 minutes. 

Please help me sir by giving just one chance to show my work to you and I hope you would also like it. 

Have a nice day. 

Thanking you,
Harshit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Big Bang theory needs a complete formulation of M-theory/The eleventh dimension theory
Therefore, the membranes theory needs to compress its additional dimensions to build candidate models for the four-dimensional world
(The fourth dimension of our world is time)
Because the M- theory is the eleventh dimension theory
We ask mathematicians and physicists to create correct mathematical equations in order to fully formulate the membranes theory
The number of dimensions in M-theory is 11
But the number of spatial membranes in the M- theory is a mere nine
The necessary suggestion is:
( such a formulation should describe two- and five-dimensional objects called branes and should be approximated by eleven-dimensional supergravity at low energies )
Please communicate the request as well as the necessary suggestion to mathematicians and physicists]]></description>

I used to be on your email distribution list but somehow got dropped. I would always enjoy reading your papers and “Of particular Significance”. 

I am merely curious of the science you discuss but tremendously enjoy reading your publications: (However I have no formal education in the field. Thanks very much for all the information you provide.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello professor. Im hoping you might help me understand or clarify  this question.  I think I it confuses a lot of people. I was reading your entry on the higgs field and you state that the field can no more be made of bosons than air being made of sound waves. But elsewhere the higgs field is described as countless bosons existing everywhere. Or a condensate of them interacting with each other. Or that the boson is to the field what a water molecule is to the ocean. Alternately that there are no bosons in deep space, rather massive particles emit and absorb Higgs bosons much like a photon decays to virtual electron positron pairs. So higgs are purely virtual unless made in an accelerator.]]></description>
