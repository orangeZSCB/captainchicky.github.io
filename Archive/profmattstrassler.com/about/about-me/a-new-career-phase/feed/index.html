					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
I am a retired employment job-training specialist. It&#039;s been a while since you posted anything. So, if you you don&#039;t mind me asking, where are you now? What are you doing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am deeply grateful for your rare ability to make the complex, and sometimes hidden, leading edge of particle physics understandable to so many of us who are not in your field.

With my best wishes and Congratulations on your new adventure. May it be even more fruitful than the last.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/about/about-me/a-new-career-phase/#comment-43301&quot;&gt;:)&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, I can&#039;t tell you or advise you where to apply without knowing much more about you and your personality and goals, but I can tell you this: Simon&#039;s Rock is one of the best liberal arts colleges in the nation, with a rigorous and intense academic program, yet it has unique features that you should know about before you apply; most students (not all) go there after 10th or after 11th grade, rather than after 12th, so they are very highly motivated, but also a bit younger on average than the usual beginning college student.  Also the college is small --- that means that students get a great deal of individual attention (there are no large lecture classes of 100 people, for instance), but it still might not be what you want.  Also, unlike the University of Houston, it is in a rural area (though an interesting one).  So I would say it is an excellent school, far better than most (certainly after I spent some time at Princeton I appreciated how much better Simon&#039;s Rock is, in a number of ways --- students get far more feedback from faculty at Simon&#039;s Rock, and write far more papers) --- but it still isn&#039;t for everyone.  I am sure if you contact the admissions folks at Simon&#039;s Rock they will be happy to tell you all about it.  http://simons-rock.edu/admission, and 413-644-4400 (just ask for the admissions office).

If you want further advice after you&#039;ve had a chance to talk to them, feel free to ask --- at which point you&#039;ll have to tell me more about your goals.  But you should talk to the admissions people directly first.]]></description>
