					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant! But, I have a most important question that seems to have been missed by your other readers (or, at least, your other comment authors).

Do you ever run into any internet browser compatibility problems?
A number of my blog readers have complained about my blog 
not operating correctly in Explorer but looks
