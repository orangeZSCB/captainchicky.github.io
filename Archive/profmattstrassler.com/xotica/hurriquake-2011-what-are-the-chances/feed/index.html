					<description><![CDATA[Great article!   I&#039;d love to reblog it.  Without being political, you have nailed on the head the problem with all &quot;truth&quot; that is only conjecture.  Certainly, we must often act of the best available guess.  But, because it so many times is just a guess, and so many times not a very good one, we need to learn to tread lightly when science indicates a new paradigm for society.  The same data that once warned us of a coming Ice Age was then used to predict disastrous global warming.  It&#039;s likely that not either one will be the case.  In the meantime we are wasting trillions and bankrupting nations based on &quot;scientific evidence&quot;.]]></description>
