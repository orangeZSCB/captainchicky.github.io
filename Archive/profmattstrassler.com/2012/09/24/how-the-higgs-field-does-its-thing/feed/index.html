					<description><![CDATA[Dear Dr. strassler :
If all quantum fields are existing in a state of inter-penetration -- in same place in same time -- in the arena of space-time , then why ALL possible interactions does not occur simultaneously resulting  in a state of total chaos ?
What is the directing mechanism that controls interactions so that they  result in our ordered universe  while ALL interactions are simultaneously possible.?]]></description>

I think your first line &#039;fundamental particles would still be massive is the point I&#039;m questioning - take away the only consistent source of mass (Higgs field) and would the other mechanisms still act as we see today - is there a fundamentalism we are missing??
My concerns with graviton come from a bigger issue with quantum mechanics - I know it works but I&#039;m with Einstein in my dislike for it... I really hope I see a theory to replace it and combine QM &#038; relativity removing uncertainty in the process in my lifetime!]]></description>

Your clarity and patience are both welcome &#038; very helpful - the maths regarding stress tensors is now beyond me without revision but lm glad at least we can class the two &#039;masses&#039; as different - the only question then is one more fundamental (feels like field generated mass should be, and, as the only field always on Higgs is &#039;the most&#039;).
I kinda remember my relativity theory, I guess the point I&#039;m struggling with is because Higgs is always on and therefore gives everything that reacts with it mass it is therefore a gatekeeper which guarantees nothing can travel at c - so it feels like it should have some more fundamental role in relativity something like, &#039;the fundamental theory that explains why Higgs is always on is the underlying theory behind relativity&#039;....]]></description>

Without the Higgs, the Universe would be a very different place, but many fundamental particles would still be massive (the suite of fundamental particles would be different, masses would be different, the interactions would be different, but it&#039;s not like rest energy would no longer exist).  I&#039;m not really sure what you&#039;re saying in this comment other than that.  It is a reasonable position to doubt the graviton as envisioned now (massless spin 2 particle with minuscule coupling) so long as it is outside the realm of experimental testing, but not because of anything related to the Higgs or the generation of rest energy.]]></description>

Quick answer?  Rest energy and contributions from moving energy such as that of photons show up in different entries in the stress-energy tensor in general relativity.  They are not, precisely, equivalent.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_energy_tensor

The contribution from anything but rest energy is normally so small that we don&#039;t include the contribution.

To your second question:  thinking about mass and energy in terms of how it produces gravity is confusing and I don&#039;t do it.  Just remember special relativity as to why a massive (= gets rest energy from some source) particle can&#039;t go c--infinite energy is required to accelerate any starting rest energy to c.  If a particle isn&#039;t burdened with a starting bucket of energy, it is *required* to travel at c.

Friction from space is not a good way to think of a photon&#039;s experience, either.  It&#039;s not that massive particles feel friction that slows them down.  It&#039;s that they must accelerate their rest energy to c in order to travel c, and this requires infinite energy.  A photon or other massless particle has no energy it must accelerate to c, and moreover if it ever travelled slower than c special relativity would break down, fundamentally because there would exist a reference frame in which the photon does not exist (the photon&#039;s *own rest frame*).

Remember E = mc^2/Sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}, so if m is 0, E is also 0, unless v is also equal to c, and so v *must* be equal to c.  But if m is nonzero, E = (something nonzero) / 0 if v = c, which can be read as &quot;a massive particle requires infinite kinetic energy in order to travel c, and more than infinite energy in order to travel faster than c.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry to repeat but it posted in the wrong place in the thread.....

To expand a bit further I&#039;ve always envisaged that once you have mass (through the Higgs field) it is easier to accumulate it but if you don&#039;t have mass there is no way to &#039;gain weight&#039;, hence particles get heavier as they move faster or interact with other fields but photons don&#039;t. - that Higgs is somehow responsible for e equaling mc squared as opposed to being equivalent (which is why I guess I have always doubted the graviton)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again these are really helpful descriptions, particularly the description of the differences between the fields but I&#039;m old and slow!  You said before energy of any form warps spacetime to create gravity. A high energy photon therefore warps spacetime? How&#039;s is that warping different from a rest energy warping of spacetime (assuming I&#039;ve understood correctly and rest energy warping = mass)? 

Looking at it another way around in my head, why can you not have a particle which interacts with the Higgs field which can travel at the speed of light if there is no difference between the warping of spacetime from rest energy and that from kinetics?

I do apologise for the slightly low level questions its just that I always had this image of photons skating around the contours of spacetime with no friction (warping of spacetime through the Higgs field) and therefore never slowing down, but if I understand you correctly they do have friction through their kinetic energy so why doesn&#039;t it slow them down?]]></description>
