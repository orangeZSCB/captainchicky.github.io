					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not really on topic here, but ever since I read Penrose&#039;s &lt;i&gt;The Road to Reality&lt;/i&gt; I&#039;ve wondered about his suggestion there that electroweak symmetry breaking creates its own horizon problem, one that isn&#039;t resolved by the current inflationary universe model. 

Would the Higgs field as it&#039;s currently understood have developed defects as the universe cooled below the critical temperature, and if so how could they have properly &quot;unwound&quot; across the whole of the presently observable universe if the outer edges of it haven&#039;t been causally connected since before the end of the electroweak era? 

In looking through the relevant papers I&#039;ve not been able to find any mention of the issue at all, save for one Powerpoint presentation that showed an intriguing mess of squiggly lines in a slide depicting the late stages of the Higgs field&#039;s phase transition, unexplained in the accompanying text.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazing work, bringing this level of science to the masses in this way is priceless and will no doubt inspire a new generation of great thinkers. You&#039;ve certainly inspired me to bury my head in the quantum world again. My only problem - I&#039;ve ran out of reading material! Apart from Brian Cox and Mr. Hawking can you recommend anyone else capable of this wonderful, yet understandable elaboration?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Prof. Strassler,

thanks very much for uploading the slides, watching and reading them just made my evening :-). 
They are just beautiful, informative, and funny at times.
I&#039;m soooo jalous of people who were able to see this live, I hope they propperly appreciated it ;-)

Cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You can copyright ideas (like a book, or a patent). But you can&#039;t copyright a physics law, an equation, or a principle.

Kind regards, Gastón]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your articles are the best stuff I&#039;ve found on understanding the Higgs field.  I&#039;m trying to readjust my thinking again on what the stuff of the universe is made of.  First I was taught everything is particles and waves.  Then I learned everything is particles.  Now I am learning everything is fields with waves in them.]]></description>
