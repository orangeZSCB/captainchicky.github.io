					<description><![CDATA[So now that OPERA had 5 sigma and Minos had more than 2 sigma, we could have considered the FTL neutrinos a given? ... No!

Let’s be careful about combining independent experimental results and, also, let&#039;s make sure we are actually dealing with a 5 sigma machine.

One question I have for the Professor is are our sensors getting lost in the &quot; &quot;vacuum noise&quot;? In other words, to find the SM Higgs boson we need to create extremely high temperatures at a very small volume. So, is this bump the SM Higgs boson or is it a transition region of the unstable vacuum and turns into and stable field? If so, are we messing around in a region we should not be? Could we be opening another Pandora&#039;s box?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Physicists Inch Closer to Proof of Elusive Particle By DENNIS OVERBYE:
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/science/physicists-inch-closer-to-proof-that-higgs-boson-particle-exists.html?_r=1&#038;ref=science

Judging by his continuous writing, Dennis must have  passion for particle physics. To six physicists he mentions, who won J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics in 2010 - Carl R. Hagen, Francois Englert, Gerald S. Guralnik, Peter W. Higgs, Robert Brout (May 3, 2011), T.W.B. Kibble, he should have also added two important names - Philip  Anderson and Yoichiro Nambu . And going even further, the work that too was somewhat instrumental and helpful at the time was 1957 BCS theory, by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/02/excitement-at-fever-pitch/#comment-12705&quot;&gt;jg&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the problems (before the work of Higgs et al.) with massive gauge bosons was that their mass wasn&#039;t &quot;gauge invariant.&quot;  If you naively give a gauge field a mass, then you lose the gauge symmetry which defines its structure/interactions.  So, we start by looking at the electroweak symmetry, which in technical group theory terms means a symmetry structure of &quot;SU(2)_W x U(1)_Y&quot;.  Here W refers to weak and Y refers to hypercharge.  The is point that we don&#039;t have an independent electromagnetism or photon until we &quot;break&quot; this symmetry to a smaller part of itself, U(1)_EM, and group theory tells us that there are four independent fields here.  Three from SU(2)_W and one from U(1)_Y.  Eventually we will arrange the fields in such a way that particular combinations are the charged Ws, Z, and photon.

The Standard Model gives a mass to the W and Z, but not the photon, by postulating a four-component Higgs field that has two properties: it carries an electroweak charge but not an electric charge, and it has a vacuum expectation value (VEV).  When you deduce the consequences of the VEV, you find that the charged weak boson fields (W&#039;s) and the combination of the electrically neutral components of the electroweak gauge boson field that does couple to weak charge (the Z) gain a mass from three of the components of the Higgs field.  Since the (simplest) Higgs doesn&#039;t have an electric charge it doesn&#039;t interact with the other combination of the neutral electroweak fields which doesn&#039;t couple to the weak charge.  This combination we identify as the photon.  Similarly, since the Higgs carries no color charge the gluons remain massless.  We&#039;re left with one more component of the Higgs field which is physical and can propagate on it&#039;s own.  This is what we call the Higgs boson when we talk about producing Higgs field quanta.

Now, mass terms for the quarks and leptons also violate the gauge invariance of whatever gauge groups (i.e. symmetries) they&#039;re charged under.  The fermion fields are not defined by the symmetries of the Standard Model like the gauge fields are, but rather arranged to interact with the gauge fields in a systematic way.  Having no gauge symmetry that defines them, we can&#039;t use the Higgs mechanism to grant them mass.  However, in the equations of the SM we can write a term involving the fermion fields and the Higgs field that is gauge invariant (so called Yukawa terms).  When we go through the process of breaking the electroweak symmetry, the fermion fields also acquire a mass term involving the Higgs VEV.  But since we don&#039;t have a gauge symmetry to tell us how strongly the Higgs and fermions interact, we&#039;re left with one free coupling parameter for each fermion field.  By enforcing these mass terms to be equal to the observed mass, we set the coupling parameter between the Higgs and each fermion field (with caveats about neutrinos which aren&#039;t important here). 

The Yukawa term, after symmetry breaking, gives not just a fermion mass but also an interaction between the physical component of the Higgs field that remains and each fermion.  These come complete with that unspecified coupling parameter above, but since we then define it through the fermion mass terms, we now know the interactions between the Higgs and fermions as well as the Higgs and the weak gauge bosons.]]></description>
