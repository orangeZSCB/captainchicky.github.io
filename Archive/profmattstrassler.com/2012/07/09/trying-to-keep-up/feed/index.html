Hi Matt &#038; Leonid: your comments are fascinating but I suspect that the debate could best be continued productively and amicably in a neutral coffee shop. I would gladly pay for the coffee, on the condition that I could audit. May I however impose a last question, as before asked out of ignorance? Has an old problem such as the Uelhing shift been studied from the three perspectives of renormalized, effective and lattice field theories? I suspect that again my question may be wrong-headed but perhaps you could recast it more soundly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt

I had read both Peskin and Schroeder and some of Srednicki, and certainly I am familiar with the work of Wilson (I presume you means his 70s work on renormalization), but I have never got the message from it the renormalizability is irrelevant. It is in fact the fact the hidden symmetry theories  a la anderson are renormalizable which led to belief in the weak interaction theory of Weinberg. And if that is still in the 70s, then t&#039;hooft Noble prize was much more recent, in 1999.  And what is it that he elucidated in &quot;elucidating the quantum structure of the electroweak interactions in physics&quot;, if it wasnt the renormalizability of Weinbergs theory (and QCD). I am sorry I am completely perplexed by your point of view.]]></description>

Unitarity is another matter -- that is required. 

Renormalizability changed after Wilson -- late 1960s, early 1970s.  That was after Higgs wrote his paper; the fact that he had a motivation that we no longer see as essential doesn&#039;t matter, the point is that he pointed out a suitable mechanism which is in fact the right answer.  It may seem heretical to you, and to the books you are reading, but you had better read the modern books... for instance, Georgi on effective field theory, or Peskin and Schroeder, or Srednicki, etc.  I&#039;m at a workshop on Higgs physics and nobody giving talks here is insisting on renormalizability in their discussions...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a bit heretical.. There are countless books written in the 80s, 90s and now expounding the virtues of renormalizability as the basis for any good QFT.

To a modern particle physicist, that is correct.  It used to be considered to be important.  The change in viewpoint occurred during the late 60s and 70s due to the work of people like Leo Kadanoff and Ken Wilson.]]></description>

The theory of quantum gravity is just fine, if we treat it as an incomplete theory... a so-called &quot;effective&quot; theory, valid for processes below 10^18 GeV in energy.

The goal of the LHC is to help us find the effective theory that applies at the TeV energy scale and perhaps somewhat above.  Again, we expect it to be an incomplete theory --- since it doesn&#039;t include gravity, it won&#039;t apply above 10^18 GeV in energy either, and may fail well below that for other reasons.

The problem of quantum gravity is finding a *complete* theory -- one that is *not* merely an effective theory and can be used at energies far above 10^18 GeV energies.

So there&#039;s no problem with having a non-renormalizable effective theory emerging from LHC data --- it will just mean there&#039;s more for us to learn about physics at higher energies in order to make the theory more complete.  [We have a non-renormalizable theory for the interaction of hadrons and it works very well for energies well below 1 GeV; above (or below) 1 GeV we use the more complete theory of quarks and gluons.]  And its non-renormalizability has no bearing on the need to find a complete theory of the world, fusing what we known about quantum field theory with what we know about gravity, and perhaps other things we don&#039;t yet know.]]></description>

Matt: thanks. If the LHC data are consistent with a non-renormalizable field theory, then is not the principal objection to quantum gravity, namely that it is non-renormalizable, removed?]]></description>
