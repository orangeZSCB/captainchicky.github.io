Regarding Xezlec&#039;s comment on the Cray 2 only being 2 gigaflops vis a vis LHC farms, I thought I would add in how another non-expert is interpreting things...

The way I interpreted the answer was that that specific process (the 2 photon decay) must have some sort of &quot;property&quot; that makes it &quot;easier&quot; to build a detector for just that decay, and that you can do a lot of the &quot;computing&quot; (or throw-away) just by building a detector just for that decay.

Alternatively the 2-photon decay may dominate (I guess I need to go through the Higgs articles and check).  So you might only have to count the total number of collisions at 125 GeV and not do _any_ selection or whatnot, and so not need much computing power at all.

Of course I have no idea if I&#039;m anywhere near the right track.]]></description>

Regarding the &quot;weren&#039;t that weak&quot; remark... when it came out in the mid-eighties, the Cray 2 was the fastest computer in the world because it could do almost 2 GFLOPS.  My little desktop PC probably gets close to 100, and that&#039;s not even counting the GPU.  The high-level triggers alone at the LHC use farms of *thousands* of modern PCs.  So it is a little hard (for me, at least) to picture how the SSC would have worked.  Would it just have thrown away a lot more data?  Or recorded it more quickly?]]></description>

Thanks! I had never seen that figure of 10-80% in all the articles I read about this. It makes me appreciate even more how difficult these measurements are if they have to figure out how often the decays can occur and yet not be spotted by the experimenters, for all those different reasons you mentioned. It really is an incredible, incredible feat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding how far can this boson deviate from the SMH and still be called a Higgs boson, I would say it has to deliver the Higgs mechanism. The postulated Higgs is unique not because it is a heavy new boson, but because it has a non zero (and in fact extremely large - at the scale of the weak interaction) vacuum expectation energy - or loosely speaking density in the vacuum. I believe the only way this can be shown is if its production/decay cross sections, at least to other bosons, are in accord with the Higgs mechanism.]]></description>
