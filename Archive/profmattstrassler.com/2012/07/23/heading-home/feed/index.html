OK, if I calculate a cross-section, I get a peak at s=m^2 from the pole in the propagator, which I&#039;ve just been happy to interpret as scattering via a real unstable particle, and scattering at other energies as virtual particle exchange. Is this OK?]]></description>

Once the Higgs field becomes non-zero, weak-isospin quantum numbers are not conserved [at least not apparently so, because they can be absorbed by the Higgs field.]  So the question doesn&#039;t make sense, and that&#039;s why you&#039;re getting confusing answers.

Before the Higgs field is non-zero, the Higgs is a doublet and has a +1/2 and -1/2 component.  By convention the -1/2 component is usually taken to be the one with a non-zero value.

The W+ W- H interaction appearing in vector boson fusion, in fact, &lt;strong&gt;does not exist&lt;/strong&gt; if the H field is zero.  The vertex would only be W+ W- H0* H0, which does conserve isospin.  Only once H0 has a non-zero value v in the vacuum does it become v W+ W- H0.  Indeed, this is why the existence of vector boson fusion is a direct test of the Higgs mechanism for mass generation.  The same is true for q qbar --&#062; W + H.  We&#039;re all looking forward to convincing evidence that these processes do occur.]]></description>

Mike: find a used copy of Bjorken and Drell vol One (1)  and work through it line by line. You know enough math. It doesn&#039;t cover the Standard Model but you&#039;ll then be able to see the wood for the trees in the more up-to-date books with Ryder&#039;s QFT  a great first choice. And check out Leslie Howard playing Abschied on Youtube.]]></description>

Prof, I have another distantly related question..What is the weak isospin of th Higgs boson (3rd component of weak isospin)?  I see a different  answers to this (0 or 1/2).  Based on vector fusion production, it would seem to me that it is 0.  I&#039;m confused.  Thanks again.]]></description>

This is a general question, not specific to the Higgs.  Let&#039;s consider the W particle.

At the Tevatron and LHC, one can produce the process quark + anti-quark --&#062; electron + anti-neutrino via a W particle.  The question is: how can you tell the difference between a real W and a virtual W, when they both lead to the same final state?

The answer is clear, but the difference is not sharp; there is a cross-over region between the two.  The longer is the lifetime of the particle, the sharper is the distinction and the smaller is the cross-over region. 

Exactly the same issue arises for any resonant system, like a ball on a spring.  A spring has (a) a resonant frequency (how the spring vibrates on its own), (b) a damping time (how long it takes for vibrations to die out).  In particle physics these correspond, in precise mathematical analogy, to (a) the mass-energy [E=mc^2 energy] of a particle, and (b) the lifetime of the particle.

If the damping time is infinite (a perfect oscillator) then if you push on the system in a periodic way, you will either get a huge response from the spring, if you push with the resonance frequency, or a very limited response, if you push with any other frequency.  The further away you are from the resonance frequency, the more muted the response.  This corresponds, in precise mathematical analogy, to the statement that for a particle like an electron with an infinite lifetime, you either have a real electron or a virtual one; there is a sharp distinction.  And highly virtual electrons are harder to make than slightly virtual ones.

If the damping time is finite (a more realistic oscillator), then a strong response by the spring will occur as long as you are pushing quite close to the resonant frequency, but not necessarily on top of it; the difference of the pushing (&quot;driving&quot;) frequency and the resonant frequency should be smaller than the inverse of the damping time.  If it isn&#039;t, you&#039;ll get a weak response.  This corresponds, in precise mathematical analogy, to the statement that if you smash a quark and anti-quark together --- trying to push the universe at a particular frequency in order to make W particles --- you will have a very decent chance of making a W as long as the energy of the quark and anti-quark differs from the mass-energy of the real W by something less than the inverse of the W&#039;s lifetime times Planck&#039;s constant. But if the collision energy differs very greatly from the mass-energy of the W, you will instead get a very weak response from the universe, and thus will produce the electron and anti-neutrino with a greatly suppressed probability.  The first regime involves a real but unstable particle; the second involves a virtual particle; and there is a cross-over between the two regimes.

For the Higgs, whose lifetime is very long compared to Planck&#039;s constant divided by the Higgs mass-energy, the distinction between the two regimes is very sharp, not as sharp as for an electron but much sharper than for the W.]]></description>

Is there a proper distinction between a process that involves scattering via virtual Higgs exchange and a process which sees the same final state products coming from the decay of a real, but unstable Higgs?]]></description>

Yes, there is a Higgs force, due to the Higgs field, just as there is an electric force due to the electric field (which is just what virtual photons are in this context); yes, because the Higgs has spin-zero, the force is always attractive. But it is very short range, a bit shorter than the weak nuclear force (because the Higgs is a bit heavier than the W and Z).  Also, for ordinary matter, it is much, much weaker than the weak nuclear force --- ordinary matter is made from very lightweight particles, which are lightweight precisely because their interaction with the Higgs field is very small --- though for top quarks the effect is quite significant and may someday be observed, with a precision measurement.

It is indeed a fifth fundamental interaction.  But it&#039;s also different from the other four in certain ways (each of the other four has something to do with a conservation law, while the Higgs interaction does not.)

Don&#039;t make too much of the &quot;zig-zag&quot; picture.  There is no change in direction when a particle interacts with the Higgs field.  I&#039;ve explained this somewhat more accurately in https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/

A more complete physical description of how the Higgs field induces mass for other particles will appear on this site soon (a couple of weeks if all goes well.)]]></description>
