See the previous answer; the issue is that a Beyond-the-Standard-Model theory may have fewer unknowns, or at least a very different set, than the Standard Model itself, which has something like 20 parameters and an assortment of particles that don&#039;t seem entirely satisfactory.

Think about how quantum mechanics and particle physics explain the periodic table of the elements; there really is an explanation there, even though new questions are raised.]]></description>

If you&#039;re asking whether a complete theory can explain itself, no, there will always be the question of &quot;why this Beyond The Standard Model (BSM) theory and not a different one?&quot;  But at least the number of unknowns might decrease as we learn more.  I personally don&#039;t believe we&#039;re likely to get a &quot;final&quot; answer.]]></description>

the LHC is still in early stages... there is plenty of time left, and plenty of searching to do.

IF nothing else is discovered at the LHC, then the future will depend on what my colleagues and I figure out in the meantime.  Maybe someone will have a good idea.  There are certainly other routes to pursue, though the LHC seemed to me to be the best bet for the near term.

At worst, only &lt;strong&gt;particle&lt;/strong&gt; physics (and probably not all of it) will stagnate.  Physics of other sorts will continue on just fine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[P.S. : what kind of logic is able to justify that if we have ( n) values with unknown  mechanism for their specifications , then if we have ( n+m) values all specifications will be explained ?
That is exactly the SM vs. BSM  deception  adopted by some !!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As it is a proven logical axiom that no formal system can in principle be explained from within , then would you please clarify why many physicists insist that the BSM will explain the SM.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear professor Matt . : is it logical to assume that discovering new particles and forces can explain all of the S.M. ......
or the expanded BSM will need  a still higher level of explanation ?
I MEAN IS IT LOGICAL FOR THE BSM TO BE EXPLAINED FROM WITHIN ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fine , then if the new particle is 100% S.M. higgs , BUT nothing new or BSM was discovered thru  the LHC,,,,,,does that mean  stagnation of physics ?
What other windows do we have ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When will the 2012(until june) 8 TeV data  data made public?

Of course, I want to say about anything else (mainly SUSY)  than the already shown 8 Tev data used to discover the Higgs particle.]]></description>
