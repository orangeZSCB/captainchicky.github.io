Flatness simply means that parallel lines neither converge nor diverge as you move across the universe.  There&#039;s no notion of thickness associated to flatness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Somewhat off-topic. So now that it has been determined that the universe is flat and open, I would think that the flatness is 3-dimensional, I.e. it has a depth, or thickness. So what is the thickness of the universe?  And is it exapnding in all 3 directions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;... no model with new forces and forces seems to work very well.&quot; If a model using SU(5) or SU(8) happens to be empirically valid, then would the predicted new effects be out of range vis-a-vis the contemporary technology of high-energy physics?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Scientists create plastic plant people that can do anything YOU want!&quot;

I don&#039;t remember the source of my citation, but the author parodied the supermarket tabloid headline.  There is a book, _Why People Believe Strange Things_ that delves into the subject.

It is so much easier (by orders of magnitude)  to read about discovery than to do it.  The popular media are spoiled by the scheduled surprise of sports.  On the other hand, the popular American reader is more likely to be able to play baseball than to do arithmetic with scientific expressions.

Don&#039;t even try to satisfy the popular media with science.  As dear Professor points out, that way leads to cold fusion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Understood that without double/triple confirmation science stories should be labeled &#039;unconfirmed&#039; as you said. 

However, I think there is a larger problem - there is a significant &quot;demand&quot; for science related stories and a lack of supply from the scientific community. At the very least, there are few well known resources that readers can go to. So this demand seems to be fulfilled by the next best thing - which may not always apply scientific rigor.

My suggestion for a solution - more blogs such as this one. Perhaps a recognized news source from the scientific community that people can go straight to, rather than read it in yahoo news.]]></description>
