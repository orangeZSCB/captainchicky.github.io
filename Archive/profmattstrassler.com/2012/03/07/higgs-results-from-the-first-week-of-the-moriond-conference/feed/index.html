I agree with Ben that the analyses are done in a blind manner  -- by being optimized in expected sensitivity -- but there&#039;s an additional requirement for a truly blind analysis: reporting exactly what you find, no matter what it is.

In practice, there is more second-guessing of unexpected results (eg Wjj excesses), leading to cross-checks etc that can potentially get the result scuttled and never reported. 

So if another experiment has reported an interesting hint, it&#039;s not hard to imagine that it would boost the confidence of experiments whose results in data appear to confirm it.

I&#039;m not suggesting that CDF or D0 did anything other than a perfectly blind analysis, but I see the point Matt is making that the process can&#039;t helped but be influenced by the LHC results. We can only speculate about what the Tevatron would have reported, when they would have announced it and how they would have phrased it in the absence of the LHC results.

Fair question.  Unfortunately there&#039;s no way for me to know; they didn&#039;t give enough plots and details, and they cut off the plot at 200.  There seem to be little excesses in many channels, not in one particular channel that might be easy to understand.  Maybe they have a background estimation problem; maybe they are not including some subtle background and that&#039;s creating an apparent excess.  Or it may just be statistical fluctuations, with no real `explanation&#039;.  Tevatron&#039;s 2.2 sigma result would be largely uninteresting on its own, because 2 sigma excesses are common; it is important in that it adds some weight to an existing case.  Of course the Standard Model Higgs (or anything like it) is completely ruled out up in that region by LHC data.]]></description>

I certainly don&#039;t disagree the argument runs both ways (creating false signals and removing real ones) and we can certainly have the same concerns about whether ATLAS has done this with their latest three searches.  The advantage they have is that they have other independent (and easier) search strategies, so if they&#039;ve removed a real signal this time, in the end it won&#039;t matter.

It&#039;s a bit like baseball --- does knowing that you are in danger of removing real signals then bias you toward making one?  Look, I don&#039;t have answers.  I just know what you&#039;re doing is really, really hard and needs some serious scrutiny by outside experts, as do all of these more difficult Higgs searches.]]></description>

Hi Matt, 

I think in practice, the opposite of what you say is true (but for almost the same reasons). 

Background modeling is an iterative procedure.  As you add more data, you have to check that the backgrounds are still well understood.  Tevatron and LHC experiments look at many control regions, and keep trying to update the modeling, adding new systematics as they become necessary.   If the overall rates and shapes of the background are consistent with data in kinematically similar control regions, it is hard to get a background contribution that mimicks signal but keeps the overall agreement looking good.  But that&#039;s what our colored bands are in our plots, the degree to which we understand the backgrounds at the 1 sigma and 2 sigma level.   Once we start seeing excesses creep out of that range, it is true that we take a hard look at our models to see if they are working properly in the control regions.   When the model works, we don&#039;t pay as much attention to it.  When there is an excess or a deficit, we use a higher level of scrutiny. This has the effect that big experiments typically slow down when we see excesses and take a closer look.  And this means that really exciting results take longer to reach the community, which is probably annoying for theorists ...

So, I would say that there is more of a risk of experimentalists changing the modeling to remove excesses, especially if there was a signal present in both the signal region and the control region.]]></description>
