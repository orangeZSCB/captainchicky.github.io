I think you are significantly overstating the case for warm dark matter.

As for what I&#039;m doing on the site; I do talk about dark matter when there&#039;s something to say:
https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/05/news-from-la-thuile-with-much-more-to-come/

However, the LHC was built to help us understand the Higgs field.  It is &lt;strong&gt;guaranteed&lt;/strong&gt; to give us insights (indeed it already has given us many.)

If the LHC helps us to understand dark matter, that will be fantastic news, as a bonus.  But there&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;no guarantee&lt;/strong&gt;. Dark matter particles may not be of a type that can be produced at the LHC at all.]]></description>

I wonder why you concentrate on the higgs as if LHC is only for it ??
As now the balance is SHIFTING TOWARDS WARM DARK MATTER  instead of the cdm  then LHC is losing a great deal as it CANNOT find wdm particles.
 This is a greater matter!! than the higgs , why you ignore it ? this is cosmic matter!!]]></description>

Thank you; I always have to balance keeping things simple with getting them out quickly, but I always do my best to give a simplified (but not simplistic) summary of important results as soon as I can.]]></description>

MATT.:
Would you please explain to the laypersons like me how we can understand the physical reality being a vast  multilevel waving ocean ---- all kinds of fields----and in the same time every single waving have its persisting  identity and every single waving/ripple is identical to the far away one --electrons for ex.--, how in the human body we got 10^28 atoms then in av. 10^30  ripples interacting in such huge harmony???
Are physical reality as fields a reality indeed or just a figment of imaginations???? can we have ultimate-- not empirical-- proof for this????]]></description>

To Matt.  : If the basic structure of reality are quantum fields , how can we understand the discrete traces of PARTICLES in all experimental particle physics ?  your world view is of basic fields then why this is not reflected in the PARTICLE traces ? we cannot imagine those tracings as ripples in a waving field.]]></description>
