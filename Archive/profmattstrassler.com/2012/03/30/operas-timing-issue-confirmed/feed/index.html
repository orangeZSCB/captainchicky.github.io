&quot;By refusing to accept even as a
possibility faster than light particles
you cannot advance science.&quot;

You insult me, and most of my colleagues, through this statement.  What evidence do you have that I, or most of my colleagues, refused to accept this as a possibility?  Find on this website, if you can, any statement in which I refused to accept this as a possibility.

It is clear to me that &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are the one with the agenda.

I said only this: &lt;strong&gt;A detection of an effect that is the same size as the imperfections of the measurement in which it appears is no evidence of anything at all.&lt;/strong&gt;  To accept your claim that we should accept such things as evidence would violate basic scientific technique that I teach to every freshman physics student.  And if we accepted your approach, not only would science never had made any progress, there would be many more medicines on the market killing people than there already are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your reply. But I still 
I have a point. You are resting your 
whole epistemological case on the 
obvious fact of the imperfections of 
measurements. You give the 
impression that all the other facts 
about neutrinos are known and so 
the matter is settled. But this was 
the whole idea of all these 
experiments - to find out more 
about the fairly strange neutrinos!
It seems to me a lot of things about 
them remain unknown. What if the 
neutrino events which appear faster 
than light are exactly that? 
We already have MINOS, OPERA 
it&#039;s true, represents a big question 
mark, but even ICARUS found 
faster than light neutrinos. You are 
attributing everything to 
imperfection of measurements, but 
let me give one example. You buy a 
ball machine, of the kind you use in 
tennis courts for training. If you 
keep it indoors, and measure the 
speed of the balls over a period of 
time, you will get a set of slightly 
different measurements, due to 
variations in temperature, humidity, 
the wearing off of the mechanisms, 
etc(of course the measuring 
instruments will have some 
imperfections attached, too). Try to 
move it in open air, and you will get 
the same variations, but at one 
point some guts of wind may slow 
or accelerate the tennis balls. That&#039;s 
exactly the point with the neutrinos. 
How can you be so sure that those 
faster or slower than the speed of 
light neutrinos are not intrinsic 
properties of their somewhat 
strange behaviour? Their 
speed/parameters could be affected 
by yet unknown conditions.  
It seems to me that the 
overwhelmingly majority of 
physicists are clinging to their own 
flogistic theories. 
By refusing to accept even as a 
possibility faster than light particles 
you cannot advance science. There are
so many unsolved problems in 
physics that nobody can be so 
arrogant as to dismiss such a 
possibility. You have eminent 
physicists which supported 
inflation, only to turn out later on 
its fiercest critics. What about the 
variable speed of light theory which 
would solve an awful lot of stuff?
Just before the turn of the XX 
century, at the Academy of science in 
Paris were presented many papers, very well 
supported mathematically, which argued against the 
possibility of heavier than air flight!
And the same happened with the 
speed of sound, rockets, etc. How 
can one  be so sure we are not on 
the verge of a totally new chapter in 
physics? Regards...]]></description>
