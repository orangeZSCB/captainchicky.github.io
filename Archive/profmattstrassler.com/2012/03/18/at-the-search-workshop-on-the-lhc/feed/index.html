I don&#039;t think any theorists believe there can be a fermi-phobic Higgs that has Standard-Model-like couplings to the W and Z, because of the large top quark mass.  It&#039;s an archaic idea.  But the experimenters did the analysis, so we may as well get some insights from what they learned.  My interest wasn&#039;t in the fermi-phobic Higgs itself but in the fact that the way ATLAS did the analysis gives us more insight into how their excess two-photon events are distributed.  (Still haven&#039;t had time to look at it carefully.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With regard to a fermiophobic Higgs: if there is a Higgs at 125 GeV that is very similar to the SM Higgs in its couplings to W and Z, as suggested by the Tevatron&#039;s evidence for WH and ZH production with H -&#062; bbar, and perhaps supported by CMS&#039;s evidence for pp -&#062; qqH, but the 125 GeV Higgs does not couple to the top, although it perhaps might couple to down-type quarks: won&#039;t this increase the required size of the Yukawa coupling of the top to the other Higgs, that gives the top its mass, because the other Higgs will have to have a relatively small VEV?  How much of an increase in that Yukawa coupling could be tolerated, before the model becomes non-perturbative?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, &quot;I still have to think this through to understand the implications fully, and will let you know when I do.&quot;

Are you able to tell us more on this now? Is the old Atlas excess for the SM Higgs significantly reduced by this new analysis?]]></description>
