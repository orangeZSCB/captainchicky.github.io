Forgive me matt. for re-talking about the stability of the neutron inside the nucleus as all what i read maximally says that the stability of the nucleus suspends the instability of the neutron!!  for me , this is just-so story as stability per se have NO  causal power to suspend the decay of the neutron, 
i just say this so that you may explain how dynamics can impose causal power on the beta decay.
THANKS MATT. ,, I AM WAITING TILL NEXT WEEK AS YOU KINDLY PROMISED.]]></description>

Clearly not.  Neutrons that are on their own, by themselves, will decay, in less than 1000 seconds (on average).  Neutrons in a stable atomic nucleus are kept stable by the dynamics of the nucleus.  This is a story I will tell soon, but not this week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/05/news-from-la-thuile-with-much-more-to-come/#comment-7288&quot;&gt;TC&lt;/a&gt;.

I think the issue here is purely semantic: I view &quot;the `symmetry breaking&#039; occurs and both W mass and top quark mass come from electroweak `symmetry breaking&#039;&quot; as &lt;strong&gt;the Higgs mechanism&lt;/strong&gt; (a consequence of the effective field theory that describes the Higgs expectation value).  I think a lot of my colleagues do as well, though this is probably not universal.  In this sense, the &quot;Higgs mechanism&quot; says nothing about where the Higgs field comes from (and in particular, nothing about whether the Standard Model is correct or whether the Higgs field is composite or whether there are multiple Higgs fields).

&lt;em&gt;Note: I try to avoid the term &quot;electroweak symmetry breaking&quot; on this website, since as is widely understood by theorists at least, a gauge symmetry is no symmetry at all, and no symmetry is broken in the Higgs mechanism.  It&#039;s an unfortunate choice of wording that we&#039;re stuck with, but I try to avoid confusing the public by repeating it.&lt;/em&gt;

The logic is that in almost perfect analogy, the Ginzburg-Landau approach to superconductivity explained many of the features of superconductors without requiring any understanding that the field that gets a non-zero value in a superconductor has something to do with Cooper pairs of electrons.  That theoretical idea could be experimentally tested long before BCS-theory explained where that Ginzburg-Landau field comes from.  I would say the Higgs mechanism is the analogy to the mechanism by which, according to Ginzburg and Landau, superconductivity occurs, and what we hope to do at the LHC is provide the analogy of BCS theory.  

Defining things this way, is, of course, a matter of convention.  If you prefer different wording, you can say that the fact that the top quark decays as expected verifies that &quot;the symmetry breaking occurs and the W mass comes from that symmetry breaking&quot;.  That&#039;s really the point.  It says nothing about what the Higgs field is, just that something of its form exists.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the updates, Matt. But I don&#039;t quite understand your first statement. Top is the heaviest known particle which get its mass from electroweak symmetry breaking so it couples to the Goldstone strongly .... Goldstone here corresponds to longitudinal W and one sees the 70% longitudinal W in top decay. Is this really the consequence of Higgs Mechanism? or simply the consequence of symmetry breaking itself? This 70% calculation does not involve any assumption really from the Higgs Mechanism....So I thought this measurement only told us the symmetry breaking occurs and both W mass and top quark mass come from EWSB but would not tell more about how the symmetry breaking takes place......]]></description>

Are you saying that neutrons do decay inside the nucleus thus  transforming elements ??? i do not believe that , it just demolish all of the atomic structure , all chemistry , all of life....!!!!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[aa.sh, regarding the stabilization of neutrons in some nuclei, it&#039;s due to Fermi&#039;s
exclusion principle.  If the neutron were to beta decay to a proton, that proton should fall into an allowed energy level within the nucleus (eventually after emitting some radiation).  If all proton levels are occupied, the neutron cannot decay.  On the other hand, if there are available proton levels, the neutron can decay and we have nuclear beta transmutation as discovered at the end of the 19th century.

Regarding THE MEANING, I&#039;ll leave that to our host...]]></description>
