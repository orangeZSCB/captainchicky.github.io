I disagree.  Many of Einstein&#039;s papers were controversial -- and widely rejected -- when they were written.  But they were not vague, not to other physicists.  This is clear from the fact that certain (though by no means all) other physicists understood them immediately, even as they rejected them.

In my career I have seen numerous breakthrough papers, nothing as big as Einstein but quite a few shockers.  They were not vague.  Confusing, yes; implausible, yes; vague, no.]]></description>

“It is very easy for a professional to recognize an amateur: there’s far too much emphasis on the horse, and not enough on the cart; equations appear out of nowhere, without clear justification; the language is vague instead of being highly precise. In Einstein’s paper, there is not a single vague or ambiguous line. 

Your mistake — the classic mistake made by most people — is in thinking the theory is the horse. The theory is the cart. The horse is the insight, the idea. The idea and the insight make the theory possible. But an insight is not a physics theory. 

JFH^^: Any clear verbal statement or equation out of the norm made by someone that understands something that reverses a major concept or advances it that is not understood is vague to the observer hearing it. But even a vague statement based on proper insight over the problem the Great Professor spent the last years of his life on in turmoil and ridicule for refusing to throw common sense away and accept God played dice with the Universe with gravity disconnected in quantum mechanics would have been all he needed to see he was wearing his missing glasses just by making his head itch a little to scratch it. Especially if the answer was on a card with two opposite sides up his sleeve and it fell out scratching his head and he noticed the moment arm of force was at the bottom on one side.

Professor, I see your cart sitting still named Atom carrying a book on “Time and Mass Oscillation” has two axels yet 3 wheels.”  ‘Yes, that’s why I ride my horse named Sugar because it is the cause of the force that pulls the cart but the book is too heavy……humm.’

“Your example of the equivalence principle is an interesting one. I think you need to read a lot more scientific history.”

Three weeks before CERN’s shocking announcement last September neutrinos were braking the most fundamental law in Special Relativity amateur’s with the ability to see things differently playing “Foldit”, an online DNA game giving them a chance shocked the World and the scientific community by cracking the AIDS virus DNA code in only 3 weeks after the experts spent over a decade getting nowhere.  So two “impossible” events happened right in a row.

Then it happened again because immediately after CERN’s shocking announcement that neutrinos were exceeding the speed of light an amateur that had previously posted his findings on time and its relationship to Mass oscillation and phosphate and sugar phase timing spent 20 minutes doing the calculations that showed Stanford’s SLAC E158 data proved CERN’s neutrino data was correct and was caused by the asymmetry of the weak force and the neutrinos had not exceeded the speed of light confirming Einstein was right again. And it also showed Einstein made a mistake when he said he made a mistake….adding the asymmetry of the weak force and the harmonic comma the two sets of data combined produced creates a new cosmological constant.  But politics remain the same.

CERN’s neutrinos exceeding the speed of light @ v-c/c=2.48 sec in 453.6 miles is an exact match with Stanford’s SLAC E158 weak force asymmetry value showing the cause of 2.48e-5 is not the politics of a “loose fiber optic cable” checked countless times with the same “gain in space” shown by FERMI Lab’s neutrinos supporting an observation that goes back to 1947 and is summed up in 2007 by G. Nimtz and A. A. Stahlhofen who also thought it occurs outside the bounds of SR [arXiv:0708.0681v1] not aware of the simple explanation E158 data provides with direct proof provided by SLAC’s E158 data exposing a gain in 453.6 miles also @ 2.48e-5 with a .20 harmonic comma as I predicted for the needed asymmetry in the reverse arrow/phase of time the calculations reveal changing physics. SLAC’s data comes from the distance light travels in 1000 years at the speed of light in a ratio to a 1 hour SOL gain making this comparative measurement the most spectacular ever made in physics and does so in regard to the most important observation in the History of Man.
 
What this means is E=m+{a}c2 outside the weak force where E=mc2 inside it because the original equation does not include the photon’s force carrier space the neutrino provides to exit the weak force to the strong force.

But the Great Professor was right: there are no dice and {a} adds the cosmological constant needed to balance “H”. But remember we are dealing with concepts built out of time so you can’t have two sides of one concept at the same exact time. You can’t put up where down goes, or movement (velocity) with non-movement (position). But since you can’t have nothing (no Observer) without something (the Observer) to create the concept of nothing this logic creates an arrow to put a concept in an information frame whereas one side will tell you the other side. God plays cards to say “I Am” and slip us a new card in the middle of saying it. 

Low to high entropy, E=h+{a-lesser diesis}c/wavelength.
 High to low entropy, E=h+{a}c/wavelength. The lesser diesis is named Einstein’s comma, but here it’s Maxwell’s Demon and it cannot be in two places at the same time/size in ratio to time.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for that.

I read somewhere that all elementary &quot;particles&quot; occupy a spherical volume of the same dimensions, radius. The difference being in the energy densities profile, cross section. If this description was valid and given your description of a &quot;jet&quot;, the stretching of the proton (hadron), then would you agree that the fundamental mechanism that gives particles a distinct characteristic is one of geometry.

I think another of phrasing this question, please correct me if I am wrong, is could bosons transition into fermions by interacting with each other. Then once a fermion it would take a finite amount of chaotic momentum transfer from other fermions and/or bosons to decay back to a boson?]]></description>

This has a complicated answer, because there are many possible ways to ask the question.

Suppose there is only one Higgs particle.  Then &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; the mass could have been very light, but that is no longer allowed by &lt;em&gt;experiment&lt;/em&gt;.  There is a model-independent bound from the LEP collider, which I think is 82 GeV, if memory serves.  No matter how the Higgs decays, it must be heavier than that, or it would have been detected, at least indirectly.  

If you ignore experiment, there is a bound at very low masses, but I no longer remember what it is.  It is again a bound that involves stability of the particular vacuum in which we live.

If the Higgs decays exactly as predicted by the Standard Model, then from experiment the mass-energy has to be bigger than 115 (from LEP) and probably 122 (from LHC). 

If you &lt;strong&gt;assume&lt;/strong&gt; that the Standard Model describes all physical processes all the way up to the energy scale where gravity becomes important (the &quot;Planck scale&quot;, about 1,000,000,000,000,000 times more energetic than an LHC collision), then you get a bound closer to 120-125 GeV; if it were lighter, the vacuum in which we live would be unstable and the universe would ended up looking very different.  But you would be making a huge assumption, and quite probably a wrong one.  

If there is more than one Higgs particle, then there is far more flexibility.  The lightest Higgs particle, if it is produced rarely enough at LEP and other colliders, can be as light as you want.

I hope all those answers are correct... I might be mis-remembering something...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt: thanks for the answer, is pretty clear. I would say that in some way the Higgs field is not reacting to vacuum, that field expands along a space of positive gravity because is not an static realm. Perhaps the expansion creates a pull, so the particles that get in the field gather mass. I would say that a substantive dash of the Higgs particle shows a close interaction with the massive bosons. If in the origin the Higgs particle is a boson at the end seems a different object.]]></description>

The energy density of the Higgs field does not contribute to gravity, so I&#039;m afraid your premise is off.

The energy density of the Higgs field can contribute to the energy of the vacuum, which itself can cause a gravitational effect. But that&#039;s true for lots of fields; nothing special about the Higgs there.  And the energy of the vacuum is not the gravity; gravity &lt;em&gt;reacts&lt;/em&gt; to the vacuum energy.  A (sufficiently large) positive vacuum energy causes the universe&#039;s expansion to accelerate.

Whether the Higgs field contributes energy density to the vacuum has nothing to do with what the Higgs particle, a ripple in the Higgs field, is doing.  It is the Higgs particle that we call the &quot;Higgs boson&quot;.  In principle, a field may contribute energy density to the vacuum and yet its ripples are massless bosons; it may contribute no energy density to the vacuum and have a massive boson as its particle.  These two issues, (a) the contribution of the field to the vacuum energy density and (b) the mass of the particles that are the ripples in that field, are completely unrelated.
 
A boson is not a massless particle; it is a particle with integer spin [spin=intrinsic angular momentum.]  Bosons can be massless or massive.  Hydrogen atoms, for instance, are massive bosons.  So are W particles.  Photons happen to be massless bosons.

You have the logic about the math backwards.  The reason the mathematical formalism treats photons as massless gauge bosons is that *experimentally* they are massless, so we write down appropriate mathematics for that.  W particles are massive gauge bosons, *experimentally*, and so we write down different mathematics for that, using the Higgs field along with a W field.  Gauge invariance makes it much easier to write the mathematics down, so we use it as a principle in the equations.  There&#039;s no physics in gauge invariance; it&#039;s a math issue.

An important thing that makes gauge bosons (massive or massless) different from Higgs bosons is that gauge bosons have spin 1, and a polarization [which, for photons, is essential in polarized sunglasses] while Higgs bosons have spin 0 and do not.  There are other differences: the possible interactions of gauge bosons with matter are much more restricted than are the interactions of Higgs bosons with matter.]]></description>
