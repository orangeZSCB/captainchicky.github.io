					<description><![CDATA[What i do not realize is actually how you 
are now not really much more well-liked than you might be right now.
You are so intelligent. You already know therefore considerably on the subject 
of this subject, made me in my view believe it from so many various angles.
Its like women and men are not fascinated unless it&#039;s something to do with Girl gaga!
Your personal stuffs nice. All the time maintain it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Integrable or non-integrable – it does not matter. When we write the system energy, for example, we write a symbolic formula without knowing the numerical values of solutions involved into it. The funny thing is that in the Classical Electrodynamics with its $latex L = \propto jA$, we formally write down some conserved quantities, but solutions involved in them are non-physical. To get a physical solution we discard the self-action contribution and arrive at the third derivative $latex \dddot x$ that leads to runaway solutions. Only using approximate $latex \dddot x^{(0)}$ helps construct something that looks as a radiative reaction force, but the energy is not conserved in such a case. I wonder what the use of the Noether theorem (apart from self-fooling) is in this particular case.]]></description>

That is an interesting point of view.  I&#039;m not sure how I feel about it. I do not know practically how I would use that point of view in the context of quantum field theory and quantum string theory, where generally the system is not integrable, and you have to go beyond equations of motion to calculate anything.

One thing that is for sure is a historical fact: that techniques based on Noether&#039;s theorem proved very useful in the development of certain subfields of high-energy physics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Integrals of motion exist without any symmetry; it is just an existence of solutions. Integrals of motion follow from the equation system, no Lagrangian is necessary. Symmetries may simplify the form of integrals of motion, but they do not fix the form: any combination of integrals of motion is also an integral of motion, so the form is not fixed. I am afraid the meaning of the Noether theorem is highly exaggerated in this respect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, It&#039;s well to remember that Emmy Noether was responsible for two very important and related theorems, not just one. The first more familiar one shows that the existence of a global symmetry implies a conservation law, but holds only provided that the equations of motion are satisfied. The second theorem relates to a local symmetry, and yields an identity (a &quot;Bianchi identity&quot;) among the equations of motion themselves. One place in which both theorems are discussed is http://nd.edu/~kbrading/Research/WhichSymmetryStudiesJuly01.pdf.]]></description>
