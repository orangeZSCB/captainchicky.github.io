We don&#039;t know how much we know about physics; it might be 99% and it might be 1%. How can we find out?  The only way is more data.  When we&#039;ve answered all the deep questions and experiment after experiment reveals nothing new, we&#039;ll give up at some point.  We&#039;re nowhere near that now.]]></description>

Yes, sorry, I was writing sloppily - I meant the ADD and RS models (and that approach in general), rather than the personalities themselves.(and I do know how to spell &quot;absence&quot;, honestly :-). I certainly wouldn&#039;t want to sidetrack a good professional blog such as this from proper physics by debating or disparaging any particular working physicist.
As a side note, I agree particularly with your last paragraph - I grow so tired of hearing people talk of scientists&#039; &quot;own&quot; theories, as if this is the way science is done - by battles between the particular pet theories of different scienists, who can countenance no alternative (of course this is indeed the way it is sometimes done, but it shouldn&#039;t be!). Science is routinely the pursuit of knowledge and understanding by honest exploration of the available opportunities, without prejudice, but the public often seem to have a hard time appreciating this, or that scientists may genuinely subscribe to the principle. For those who have poured a career into SUSY, for example, the existence of squarks etc at the LHC may well be of particular personal interest, but for the rest of us, the interest is academic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/20/latest-from-the-search-workshop/#comment-7937&quot;&gt;Gnart&lt;/a&gt;.

Well -- you want to be a little careful here.  The particles we know about get their mass from the Higgs field.  Most particles in nature may not; in particular, dark matter particles may not.  I&#039;ve emphasized this many places around this website; the Higgs is NOT the ``universal giver of mass&#039;&#039; that many articles you will read seem to imply.  For example, in almost any theory the Higgs field is only partially responsible for the mass of the Higgs particle itself!  (We don&#039;t know which of the theories is right, so I don&#039;t know yet where the rest of the Higgs mass comes from.)

However, no, it would not be at all surprising if the Higgs could decay sometimes or often to dark matter, or to other types of as-yet-unknown essentially undetectable particles. Searches for an ``invisible&#039;&#039; [i.e., undetectably-decaying] Higgs are planned for this year; last year we didn&#039;t have enough data yet.  That&#039;s one of many different types of searches for Higgs particles that will be necessary if a Standard-Model-type Higgs is ruled out with this year&#039;s data.

I haven&#039;t had time to write about Daya Bay and the other experiments that tell us something new about neutrino mixing; it&#039;s interesting but the LHC takes precedence right now in my mind.]]></description>
