We might know what the formula is, but the calculations are extremely difficult.  Think multi-dimension PDEs. My understanding (I&#039;m not a physicist) is that there are heuristics that can simplify things, but it&#039;s not always clear that the heuristics are correct.]]></description>

I hope this question has an answer a layman can understand. I&#039;d guess it&#039;s contributions that have been known to be difficult to calculate but previously believed to be very small.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;But the experts have been backing away from this point of view recently, worrying that maybe they know less about how to calculate this in the Standard Model than they used to think.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am not sure how to read this -- surely `how to do&#039; a calculation in the standard model is well understood? 
Let ,me rephrase that -- which sort of calculations (I guess those involving quarks are the suspect ones) are not understood?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[CP stands for Charge-Parity, right?
If weak interaction does violate weak charge conservation (It is called weak isospin, am I right?), then such violations could also happen in eletric and chromo charge too?
Thanks for your time, Matt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt: &quot;Back then, the relevant experts (and I should emphasize I am not one of them) would have told you that they were pretty darn certain that the Standard Model [the equations we use to describe the known particles and forces] could not produce CP violation of this type, and any observation of a non-zero signal would imply the existence of previously unknown particles.  But the experts  have been backing away from this point of view recently, worrying that maybe they know less about how to calculate this in the Standard Model than they used to think.  If we’re to be sure this is really a sign of new particles in nature, and not just a sign that theorists have trouble predicting this quantity, we’re going to need additional evidence from another quarter.  And so far, we haven’t got any.&quot;


Among all blog reports on this LHCb result, the above passage is the only one having the relevancy to the importance of this result. Thanks Matt.]]></description>
