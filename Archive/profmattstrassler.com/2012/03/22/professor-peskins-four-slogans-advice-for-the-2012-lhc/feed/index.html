1) the masses of superpartner particles could be all over the place, in principle.  Data seems to indicate that the partners of the up and down quarks (which are easy to make, because of the up and down quarks in the proton) are probably above 1 TeV/c^2 in mass, but data on the top squark (much harder to make) is much less constraining.

2) There is no simple review on the masses of superpartner particles, because although supersymmetry predicts they exist, supersymmetry is broken (or &quot;hidden&quot;, to say it better) in nature, and there are so many ways to break supersymmetry that the masses of the superpartners could be anywhere.  The only constraint is that in order to address the hierarchy puzzle, certain key superpartners (Higgs partner, top partner, and gluon partner) must be below a few TeV/c^2 in mass.]]></description>

Thanks for the reply. I understand the second point that  non strongly interacting super partners would have smaller cross sections for production. But do  I understand right that even amongst strongly interacting particles such as quarks, the super partners, whether they are heavier or not ,do not necessarily preserve mass hierarchy, i.e they could be all over?
Is there a simple review on masses of SS particles?]]></description>

It&#039;s a question of detail; the top superpartners can be, and in many models are, the lightest quark superpartner.  The superpartners of particles that do not feel strong nuclear forces may be lighter, but they are harder to produce at a proton-proton collider, because quarks and gluons produce things that feel strong nuclear forces abundantly.  Compared to a squark, an object of the same mass which does not feel strong nuclear forces are much more rarely produced (by factors of 100 or so.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt, welcome back! It is not clear to me why it should be easier to detect super symmetric partner of very heavy top quark when they have failed to detect,as of today, SS partners of lighter particles, say electron, pion, proton, up and down quarks etc. Thanks.]]></description>
