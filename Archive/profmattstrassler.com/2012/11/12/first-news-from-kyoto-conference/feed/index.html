					<description><![CDATA[Sorry Professor, the hierarchy problem is fine tuned for Z and W bosons or the discrepancy is appears negligible under LHC, SM. Even after fine tuning, the discrepancy is apparent in the case of Higgs boson- may be due to frequency difference(mass) between them?. I have said Iam a layman.

 The Dirac Lagrangian for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip helicity as required for mass, so they must be massless. Therefore it seems that none of the standard model fermions or bosons could &quot;begin&quot; with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance.  

&quot;If that angular distribution of the stuff it breaks into is totally spherically symmetric, that would be spin zero. The Higgs boson has &quot;zero spin&quot;, otherwise it would be all over the place and therefore probably some other particle- it finally disappears, The Higgs particle  has a trick up it’s sleeve that the other particles in the Standard Model do not. In the language of Feynman diagrams, a Higgs line can terminate: The line just ends; there are no other particles coming out. Very peculiar! We know that ordinary particles don’t do this… we don’t see matter particles disappearing into nothing, nor do we see force particles disappearing without being absorbed by other particles. 

Sir, mass could be understood as a particle “bumping up against the Higgs boson’s vacuum expectation value (vev).”  Because of low frequency(unlike known particles like W and Z bosons) of Higgs boson on SMs PE(vev), it is impossible to differentiate &quot;chiralities&quot;- same or no chirality, required for HP mass. If it spin twice(Stroboscopic effect), also spin zero- but with different &quot;space time&quot; ?. sorry... I stop my postings.]]></description>
