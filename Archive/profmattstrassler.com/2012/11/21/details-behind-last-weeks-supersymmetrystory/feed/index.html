Not what Prof. Strassler&#039;s talking about in particular, but they&#039;ve searched and found nothing.  Of course.

&quot; reason for matter to exist&quot; is a relevance only within human perception. 
It is not important for a stone(matter), if the &quot;New space&quot; disperse the matter or not. 

Spacetime curvature become weak if matter disperse- thus family relationships, affections between humans, &quot;concentration&quot; everything will disperse. 
You need something, collective concentration, to contain this scientific relevance- which is not entirely a physical process. ]]></description>

Hi Veeramohan - i followed your link - good to see other people are thinking about the relevance and possible credence to a 4D cohabitation &#038; existence!  She expresses some interesting ideas - but at variance to mine somewhat. My expression ut, x, y z, is simple dependant upon the production of Ut: New space - as opposed to the curvature of spacetime which can only exist in the presence of matter in which features her expression.  Mine provides reason for matter to exist in the first place and the physical behaviour of things in the 3D are not really so important as it only forms part of the big picture.  Very interested to hear about her and her ideas - thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Markus - no, the red curve will not shrink to zero.  In fact it could get bigger even as the probability of the best fit point falls - that&#039;s what happened in Matt&#039;s fig 2.  To quote from the working group (arXiv:1110.3569)
&quot;The fact that much larger regions in[parameter space] are now allowed indicates that the tension between (g−2)_mu, favouring relatively low SUSY scales, and the direct search limits, favouring larger SUSY scales, has significantly reduced the sensitivity of the fits [...] for constraining the SUSY parameters. Since the chi^2 values of the best-fit points are significantly higher, and consequently the chi^2 distribution towards higher values of [the parameters] is much flatter than in the pre-LHC case, the precise location of the 68% and 95% CL contours is less precisely determined than before.&quot;
So these curves don&#039;t tell the whole story - you need to know how good the fit is as well.]]></description>
