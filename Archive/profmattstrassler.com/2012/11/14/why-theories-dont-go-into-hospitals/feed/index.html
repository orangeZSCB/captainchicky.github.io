@Theo Nieuwenhuizen

Prof. Strassler has in this and in about 20 articles before, where he had to put back what the media or zealot bloggers etc have messed up into the right scientific context, beautifully explained what can be concluded from the date and knowledge we have gained so far and what not in accordance with the scientific method concerning SUSY or other new physics. He is a very clear headed and honest scientist who is interested in nothing but the scientific truth and finding out how nature works at the deepest level. Concerning this reasonable attitude I completely agree with what Prof. Strassler uses to say, as every sane and reasonable person does and therefore have nothing to add.

People who come here to disagree with Prof. Strassler about what he very clearly and nicely explains about how science is done in accordance with the scientific method, are obviously zealots who have no clue about how the scientific method works and is applied by real physicists. They are either pro or anti SUSY/new physics zealots as Prof. Strassler calls them.

It is baffling to observe how quickly the comment sections of such articles, where Prof. Strassler just puts by the public and in the media widely misunderstood things straight and defends the right and the duty of honest and serious physicists to follow the scientific method, are overtaken by tons of crazy Anti-SUSY-new-physics zealots who understand absolutely nothing about what is explained in Prof. Strassler&#039;s articles or even worse, attack and insult him and his colleagues. You are obviously among them.]]></description>

This reaction is a few bits overdone.  To attack the messenger rather  than discuss the message, is an old, proven trick. SuSy does not do what was promised, so modesty and self-reflection of proponents is appropriate. It can still work in principle, but for now sign are: no SuSy at the LHC. Perhaps it exists only beyond the unification point, as some of the proponents believe. String theory does not reproduce the standard model, and if it does, then by about as many assumptions as there are parameters in the theory. The multiverse is an unscientific (untestable) concept arrived at after the claim that String theory explains everything. This is unfortunate reasoning, a simpler way out is consider that it is a tool, useful for some questions, and not for other questions. The multiverse was inspired by the Everett (many worlds) interpretation of quantum mechanics, which has no role in solvable models for the full measurement process, so it can and should be abandoned without any loss.]]></description>

That&#039;s true, however in this case most theories (Or types of theories) *are* quite independent. The LHC is not telling us about the underlying physics directly, but giving us data that we can then use to work things out.

Your analogy is apt, we are crashing probes into the moon to see how hard it is, only we&#039;ve just started doing so and can&#039;t rule out any but the softest cheeses. (And the alternative compositions are chalk or marshmallow.)

What we would dearly love is some evidence relating to the basic workings of SUSY itself (For or against.) which would then affect *all* SUSY theories. (Like sending a probe that measures the actual elementary composition.) All we have at the moment is evidence of the &#039;lowest&#039; sort, that tests the final results of theories. And there are always more ways to tweak a theory to make it fit that.]]></description>

Matts logic only holds true if the variants of theory X are treated as unique theories that have an equal probability of being correct with non-variant theories. This isn&#039;t true. Ruling out a large class of variants of theory X increases the likelihood that the common underlying concept for all these variants is false and thus theory X itself is false.
I have a theory that the moon is made of cheese, variants of this theory posit green cheese and others that is might be brie. We launch a probe that disintegrates on impact. This rules out brie but the moon might still be made of a cheese hard enough to destory our probe. It is more likely however, that it is not cheese at all.]]></description>
