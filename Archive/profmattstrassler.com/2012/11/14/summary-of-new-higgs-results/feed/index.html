					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, just became aware of your blog through Google, and found that 
it&#039;s really informative. I&#039;m going to watch out for brussels.
I will appreciate if you continue this in future.

A lot of people will be benefited from your writing.
Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] But here you have to remember how statistics works. If instead of asking &#8220;is this particular weird phenomenon likely&#8221; you had instead asked &#8220;is it likely that somewhere, in all of the measurements that ATLAS is making about the Higgs, one or two of them would have turned out weird&#8221;, the answer is &#8220;very likely indeed!&#8221;  I&#8217;m writing and you&#8217;re reading a post about the mass measurement &#8212; and so are other bloggers and Scientific American and all the rest &#8212; because currently this is the one that looks odd. It could instead have been that there was a double peak in the photon-based plot, or that the lepton-based plot was showing no peak at all (simply because the signal rate fluctuated down from 20 events to 11, which is just 2 standard deviations.) Or the measurements of the spin and parity of the Higgs could be looking strange.  In that case we&#8217;d be talking about those things instead.  In July people were talking about the hint that the Higgs didn&#8217;t seem to be decaying to tau leptons; well that&#8217;s over and done.
