Well, there&#039;s probably an internal reason why you aren&#039;t hearing from them right now.  Be patient for the moment.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been corresponding with one of the authors of that paper, and I&#039;m very excited. There&#039;s probably enough spectral resolution from NuSTAR to exclude redshifted iron lines (6.4 keV) for anything too faint to be in SIMBAD as a nearish galaxy, so there is a very good chance of not only getting a reasonable statistical census of Milky Way sources, but also of being able to characterize the 20-60 keV envelope which is the only thing likely to distinguish stellar mass black holes from larger ones accreting only from the low density interstellar medium, all from the data they&#039;ve already collected. 

The NuSTAR team was corresponding with me frequently and promptly, about every month up until I asked them why they weren&#039;t doing such a survey themselves when it became apparent that they weren&#039;t just before AAS last week, after which I have not received a single reply.]]></description>

Matt, the NuSTAR team remains absurdly mum and essentially punted on any preliminary black hole census that they still say in several places left over from before calibration is their top priority. But if they release data in &quot;Spring 2013&quot; as promised, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1341&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these guys&lt;/a&gt; will be all over it.]]></description>

Will do, when NuSTAR&#039;s preliminary AAS poster is out from Long Beach. I&#039;m excited about not just the very old quasars, but all the readjusted SMBH masses in the news over the past couple weeks.]]></description>

I&#039;m really not the right expert for this question, I am afraid; I really can&#039;t evaluate this kind of paper, and would call up experts if I wanted to do so.  Also we&#039;re too close to the end of the term and I just don&#039;t have time to think about it; maybe you could raise this again in the new year.]]></description>
