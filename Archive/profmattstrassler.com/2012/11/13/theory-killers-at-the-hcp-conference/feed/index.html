					<description><![CDATA[I can explain the nature of this problem illustratively with water surface model of space-time. At the water surface the particles are represented with Russel&#039;s solitons, which are formed with mutual interference of transverse and longitudinal waves in different ratio. Supersymmetry considers the existence of solitons formed in similar way but inverted ratio. Such a particles correspond the Falaco solitons which are formed at the water surface, but in the underwater. But when you observe the smallest density fluctuations, like the Brownian noise (analogy of Brownian noise), then the character of both types of solitons converges mutually and these these solitons don&#039;t differ each other anymore. It results into blow of theories, like the SUSY, which predict the dual version of each solitons at the water surface.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/13/theory-killers-at-the-hcp-conference/#comment-27028&quot;&gt;Peter Woit&lt;/a&gt;.

What do you mean by

&quot;the issue of SUSY/string theory zealotry and whether it’s a problem someone should do something about. About either the science or the sociology ...&quot;?

You should not even be thinking about trying to negatively influence physics and undermining the natural scientific process in the real world in such a manner as you obviously want to do. 
I hope all scientists and people who are in positions to make decisions are warned about you. Nobady is allowed to &quot;do something&quot; that disturbes the natural gain of knowledge in the course of the scientific process!

As I told you many times elsewhere, you have NO right to patronize physicists and other people who are much more knowledgable and smarter than you are by telling tell them what they are allowed to research, to be interested in, to think about, etc ... !!!

In trying to negatively influence science in the real world you greatly overestimate yourself in a horribly arrogant manner !!!]]></description>

... you should not be allowed to talk or write about fundamental physics, particle physics, cosmololgy, and anything related. You neither a clue nor a real honest interest in it, and you dont know anything about the scientific method which Prof. Strassler had explained here repeatedly.

Just go away]]></description>
