					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/13/supersymmetry-dealt-a-blow/#comment-46244&quot;&gt;Patrick&lt;/a&gt;.

To illustrate with numbers:

Consider 3 events in the universe:
A1: SUSY in parameter space part 1 (the part that has been explored since, say, more than 25 years LEP, Tevatron, HERA, early runs LHC...)
A2: SUSY outside of that space, so in part 2 (inaccessible or not yet explored)
A0: no SUSY

Say that the a-priori (guessed) probabilities before anything started being measured (say, 30 years ago) were:
A1: 70%
A2: 20%
A0: 10%

That is to say, a priori, people expected probably that SUSY would be discovered at LEP, HERA, Tevatron, and the early runs of LHC was 70%.  They&#039;d think it would be bad luck, but still 20% chance that SUSY wouldn&#039;t be there.  And they&#039;d give it 10% chance of not being any SUSY out there at all.  Just an example.

Now, consider the event B which is: nothing seen in part 1.
We have of course that P(B &#124; A1) = 0 (assuming competent experimenters) ; P(B &#124; A2) = 1 (excluding fraudulent experimenters) and P(B &#124; A0) = 1 (idem).

From that one can deduce that P(B) = 30%.  That is, the a priori probability people would have guessed that nothing is seen in zone A1 is 30%.

But now, B is a fact.  So using Bayes&#039; theorem, we find:

P(A0 &#124; B) = P(B &#124; A0) P(A0) / P(B)  = 100% * 10% / 30%

Which results in P(A0 &#124;  B) = 33%

In other words: 30 years ago, the a priori probability that there wasn&#039;t any SUSY was 10%, and now, with B a fact, it is 33%.  

The numbers are just an illustration.
Garrett wasn&#039;t saying anything else (and no, I&#039;m not Garrett ;-) ).]]></description>

<p>To illustrate with numbers:</p>
<p>Consider 3 events in the universe:<br />
A1: SUSY in parameter space part 1 (the part that has been explored since, say, more than 25 years LEP, Tevatron, HERA, early runs LHC&#8230;)<br />
A2: SUSY outside of that space, so in part 2 (inaccessible or not yet explored)<br />
A0: no SUSY</p>
<p>Say that the a-priori (guessed) probabilities before anything started being measured (say, 30 years ago) were:<br />
A1: 70%<br />
A2: 20%<br />
A0: 10%</p>
<p>That is to say, a priori, people expected probably that SUSY would be discovered at LEP, HERA, Tevatron, and the early runs of LHC was 70%.

<p>Now, consider the event B which is: nothing seen in part 1.<br />

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/13/supersymmetry-dealt-a-blow/#comment-27016&quot;&gt;Garrett&lt;/a&gt;.

You&#039;re right of course.  Seems that several people here have no clue of Bayesian statistics.   It&#039;s a matter of 3 or 4 lines of algebra to show that if before measurement there is a finite a priori probability, and after measurement that portion is excluded, the updated a priori probability goes down.  But of course, that is only true if in the universe of outcomes, &quot;it isn&#039;t there&quot; is present.
If you have 100 chairs in your house, then you can consider two universes:
- one with one hundred events of the style &quot;my keys are under chair number i&quot;.
- one with one hundred and one events: the same as before, plus &quot;my keys aren&#039;t under any chair&quot;.

And depending on the universe you consider, if you&#039;ve been looking under 95 chairs and didn&#039;t find anything, you can conclude: 

100% chance that they must be under one of the 5 remaining chairs (if you&#039;re using the first universe)

depending on your a prioris, but maybe 80% chance that after all, they aren&#039;t under any chair if you&#039;re working with the second universe.

So we see again that whether SUSY is &quot;cornered&quot; or whether &quot;SUSY is in hospital&quot; depends on the universe you started with :-) whether you considered the possibility that it isn&#039;t there or not from the start or whether that&#039;s not an option :-)]]></description>

The point is that this probability is irrelevant to the work of validating or invalidating the hypothesis. The only probability that could be of relevance, was the probability for the Standard Model being right about the Higgs, but this probability would also just be guesses on our part. To conclude on the Higgs particle, we need to _know_, and to know we must search _all_ of the haystack. You cannot validate a hypothesis on the basis of a human&#039;s guesses about the likelyhood of that validity. This would be analogous the failure of political pundits (both sides) in the recent US election, where opinionated bias led to predictions outside of what the actual statisticial information said.

Setting a probability on any independent aspect of a theory about nature, would be biased one way or another. What you argue Garrett, is that the &quot;position&quot; of the Higgs isn&#039;t independent, but rather depends on the exclusion of 99% of the range. Matt says that it was independent of this exclusion.

A theory like the Standard Model is a qualified guess based on previous observations, but it is not a prediction that you can attribute a probability to as the solution space isn&#039;t infinite. You don&#039;t even know how many dimensions it has.]]></description>
