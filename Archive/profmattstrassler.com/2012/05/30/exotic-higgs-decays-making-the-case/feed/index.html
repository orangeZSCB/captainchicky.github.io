					<description><![CDATA[1. Can the LHC analysis of the data allow us to decipher any nonlinear behavior of the fundamental particles. In other words are the &quot;specific particles&quot; defined by Nature or are the defined by or equations and instruments designed and derived from our equations?

2. Will renormalization prevent us from ever seeing (observations and/or formulations) of the true nonlinear behavior of Nature?    

3. Is it valid to say that the lowest possible energy of the smallest space (quanta of space) is the potential well that is filled by entropy? Hence, the zero point energy must be greater than potential well threshold in order to have motion (increasing time, evolution). Question is, do particles exist in our universe because the initial conditions at the Big Bang had some lower rate entropy inherent in the process?

4. A bigger question would be can our visible universe (massive particles) be floating &quot;on top&quot; of a grander, broader universe which energy cannot coalesce into massive particles (dark energy) ?]]></description>

hello proff,,,a while back i suggested a link between time singularity and higgs/field...after reading about a fibre switching position,,i thought i may be possible that it was due reversal in singularity caused by interference from the experiment,,,ie;observing the singularity before it is measured by time therefore producing a result dictated by the timing of the trigger....has there been any consideration to placing fibres as part of the experiment to give some indication causes for position switching...unless timing of trigger is precisely accurate to the boundaries of the singularity,,,some of the fibres,,,or one will switch positions,,,if after significant testing there is no switching,,then thats one possibility eliminated,,,,if however there is switching then much light can be shed on higgs through a better understanding of time singularity,,,a negative mass higgs is as good an indication as any that it may be worth pursuing...time is the one singularity that is a + by decaying into space,,or particle/s,,and then as particle decays from +,,its absorbed by a field of -time(passed)  another singularity following the preceeding is a singularity deducted from remaining to follow...would like to hear your thought,and or criticism,if im ignorant in my understanding then please help me be better informed,,,
thank you]]></description>

The expected 20 inverse fb at 8 TeV of energy should just be enough for the decays to two photons and to two lepton-antilepton pairs together to do the job, with the other decay modes as important supporting evidence.  Of course, if there is a particle at 125 GeV that is NOT a &quot;Standard Model Higgs&quot;, then all bets are off, because the decay rates to the various processes are likely to be altered compared to Standard Model expectations.  No way to guess what will happen in that case; there are too many possibilities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that most of the indicators for SM Higgs at 125 GeV are from the digamma channel
and 
that, although the WW channels may be good for exclusion,  their resolution is not so good for pinning down a Higgs mass within a couple of GeV or so 
and 
that the Golden Channel Higgs to ZZ to 4l is really nice for high resolution and low background but in the range around 125 GeV does not produce a lot of events for a good statistical analysis. 

If the July 2012 data (now almost 4/fb) do not show a clear result of digamma evidence for Higgs
then 
how much data will the LHC need to produce (beyond 2011 levels) to get a clear statistical picture from the Golden Channel of Higgs to ZZ to 4l for the region around 125 GeV ? 

Is the LHC likely to get that much data before the long shutdown at the end of 2012 ?
