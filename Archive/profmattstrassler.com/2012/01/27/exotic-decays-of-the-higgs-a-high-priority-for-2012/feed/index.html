					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/#comment-6012&quot;&gt;anon&lt;/a&gt;.

Good -- we&#039;re closer to being on the same page.  I of course agree (and I think everyone in the community would do so) that precise measurements of the Higgs production rates and branching fractions is going to be an essential next step of the LHC program.  

The point I am making is still a little different from yours, though.  We can get HHGG (i.e. Higgs coupling to gluons, for the uninitiated) from heavy colored virtual particles; we can get HHFF (Higgs coupling to photons) from heavy charged virtual particles.  But we can get HHSS, where S is a neutral scalar, from renormalizable operators, or from more complicated dynamics, if S is composite.  We can also have similar couplings to pseudo-scalars.  These operators can allow the Higgs to decay invisibly or to four or more particles (if the S itself decays.) And we can get HH Psi Psi (where Psi is a fermion) from loops, and even HHVV, where V is a new vector boson (fundamental or composite) again from loops or from new dynamics. There are still other operators.  And these generate qualitatively new decays, which may be quite complex, if (for example) S or Psi or V have strong self-interactions of their own.  

If these new interactions of the Higgs are small, they may have only a tiny effect on Standard Model production and branching fractions, and so no precision measurements at the LHC of the expected production and decay modes will have any chance to reveal them, soon or perhaps ever.  But these new decays may still themselves have large enough branching fractions to be measured at the LHC, if we go looking for them ... assuming, of course, that we have triggered on them at all, which is the urgent issue to be addressed right now.]]></description>
