Hi Lubos,

I am always grateful for the patience with which you have explained things.:)
I second Dilation&#039;s ouch.

&quot;Then it‚Äôs pretty hard, or pretentious, for them to place themselves ‚Äúabove‚Äù the subjects they pretend to study.&quot;

&quot;Word Pictures,&quot; may have been employed to spur on some people to react to thoughts about model building and foundations?:) You and Dali share the same view on religion?:) http://eskesthai.blogspot.com/2012/02/word-picture.html

Best,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt,

&quot;Watch a foal [= a baby horse, for my non-English-speaking readers] stand an hour after birth, and you can see how much intuitive physical understanding most animals are born with.&quot;

Yes for sure seeing this in one of my own from the past there is definitely this drive to get up. But lets say you want to affect the horses behavior for when it is much larger. Let it believe that your are very capable of picking it up at let&#039;s say 800lbs, then for sure you interrupt that cycle of animistic behavior and imprint by lifting it when it is a foal.

&quot;I‚Äôm sorry to say, however, that essential as these survival skills are, they do not count toward a degree in physics.&quot;

As layman I am sure those of us who recognize this will never believe more then what you are saying. It does not mean we cannot delve into the different concepts that one&#039;s mathematics has been voiced from sciences lips to the wider audience. So on one level you have the mathematics that you express as concepts and how accurate are these concepts when tied to that math. The laws. People are listening.

The public is trusting and in your hands. A lot of science is specialized and for that matter scientists too who have not ventured across the lines of their specializations yet they come equip with seeing the world in the way they have been trained in their science? That gives them unique perspective about looking at different aspects of life, economics ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-q0yZDTevG40/RhzvdDadw3I/AAAAAAAAAfA/OPqt50Wl3G0/s234/bumble_bee4.jpg ), and their everyday life. Yes?

The questions about the article then can further spark further questions indeed of what  Innatism( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innatism ) is, what is a blank slate( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate )and the Tabula rasa ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa ). 

So this is not about metaphysics then, but a real question about what we are capable of doing? About our not being afraid to learn? 

Not all of the public can have their teachers. As students,  can we find &quot;the teacher within us&quot; with which to move ourselves forward?  How can we adapt to learning in the day and age of the internet? The distance physically to these higher institutions of learning is great for some, yet, the student in them without age or limitation can find what they are looking for? 

The scientist trained,  occupyng a different trade until an opening comes up for them?

Best,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from the innocence of babies. We come to the subject of gravity with a good deal of predudice - not the least of which is Einstein&#039;s General Relativity (GR). Often, when food, toys, or whatever is placed before a baby in a high-chair, he will push it off the tray and down it goes. He will do this over and over, seeming to test gravity on everything you put in front of him. Simple as this is, mankind has completely failed in this regard. Since the discovery of the antiproton in 1955 (same year Einstein died) there has been speculation that antimatter might repel matter gravitationally. Yet in over 50 years, an experiment to determine the gravitational acceleration of antimatter has never been done. We are so cock sure of GR that all attempts to test the gravitational acceleration of antimatter have failed - due to lack of funding! The fact is that most physicists consider such an experiment to be a complete waste of time and money. Pretty cocky for a species that admits it only understands 4% of the Universe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My kids used to do experiments with gravity by throwing food all over the floor. They quickly discovered that cheerios and string beans fell at the same rate. Galileo would have been proud. 

But all this talk of &quot;intuitive understanding of certain physical laws&quot; because they could track hidden objects or suspect something would fall, and of &quot;rudimentary math abilities&quot; because they choose the plate with more food...well, let&#039;s not start handing out Nobel prizes to every 10-month old just yet.

I generally choose the plate with more food and it has nothing to do with math...

I agree that understanding cognition levels in developing humans is interesting and fundamentally important, but the labels, the spin, is just a bit much.
