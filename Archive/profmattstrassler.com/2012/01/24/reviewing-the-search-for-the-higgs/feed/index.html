We don&#039;t know there are any such things as superstrings.  If there are, then superstring excitations are much, much heavier than any of the particles we know, and the sources of their masses has no connection with the Higgs mechanism.  See also my articles on extra dimensions which show yet another way that particles can have masses that has nothing to do with the Higgs mechanism.  Even the Higgs particle itself doesn&#039;t get all of its mass from the Higgs mechanism.]]></description>

We don&#039;t know.  The best we can do is say that the masses of the W and Z particles and the overall strengths of the electric and weak-nuclear force are directly related (but we don&#039;t know what sets the strengths of the forces.)  For the matter particles, we have no idea what sets these strengths.  There is some hope that the LHC will shed light on this question.]]></description>

I guess the deeper issue is subconscious bias... science history is full of cases where good honest people and groups fooled themselves.... cranial volume versus race, the weak V-A theory itself (didn&#039;t the field `prove&#039; it was S+T??), the Crystal Ball Higgs.    An awful lot rides on whether there is a light Higgs... SUSY itself might be hanging in the balance.   Given all that, I would have thought the Higgs search would have been the best blinded result in particle physics history.

But again, the truth will out eventually, maybe even in 2012, but whatever is seen in the 2012 data will be tested with the 2013, 2014, ... data]]></description>

I am afraid that I still can&#039;t quite figure out what you are asking... I am sorry.  [We have two language barriers, one into English, and the other into physics!]  But I will try to answer anyway!

The situation with the Higgs particle is that we know there is a Higgs *&lt;strong&gt;field&lt;/strong&gt;* of some sort, but we do not know there is a Higgs particle.  We already know a little bit about the Higgs field from experiments.  It&#039;s existence is pretty certain, because the predictions of the theory with a Higgs field match existing experiments very well. 

But there are a number of possibilities for how the Higgs field behaves, and not all of them predict a Higgs particle.  So as far as the particle&#039;s existence, we have formulas that predict a Higgs particle, and alternative formulas that do not.  We don&#039;t know which set of formulas is right.  So whether the Higgs particle exists is something only experiment can tell us for sure. 

You can read more about this in the Higgs Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/]]></description>
