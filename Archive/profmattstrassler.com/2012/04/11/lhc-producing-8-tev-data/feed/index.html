By the way, you can see a test case on this site.  I essentially tried to do what Gowers did, in the context of Exotic Higgs Decays, back in January.  I think it is urgent and I hoped some of my colleagues would react.  But nobody did at the time.  Perhaps this is partly because it required a very long blog post just to explain the issue.  Perhaps it is because very few of the readers would have been experienced enough to get the point, and even fewer in a position to do something about it.

You realize LHC theorists make up a very small community.  A few hundred, many of whom are students. It&#039;s not a lot, for such a complex undertaking.]]></description>

I see no reason why my colleagues shouldn&#039;t think about it.  

Nevertheless, my guess is that it only works for certain types of simple problems that can be farmed out. Very few important Large Hadron Collider projects are of this sort; there are so many ways to make errors and get garbage results that it in my experience is hopeless to ask a non-expert to contribute, unless that non-expert is being supervised by an expert.   There is no way, for instance, that we could do anything resembling crowd-science in the LHC context.  It would take more experts more time to keep an eye on quality control than it would to take for them to do the project themselves.   That&#039;s precisely the problem: if you gave me 100 bright undergraduates eager to work on LHC physics, but not the 30 graduate students to supervise them and the 10 postdocs to supervise the graduate students, I would not be able to use them.

Moreover, I know enough mathematics to be confident that most problems in math also cannot be done this way.  Just because there are some exceptions does not mean that the exceptions are the rule.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Right, it wouldn&#039;t solve everything. But it would solve some things. For inspiration one can look perhaps at the MathOverflow projects and Tim Gower&#039;s polymath endeavour.

I&#039;d venture that if the math community can do this sort of thing, the LHC community should be able to as well. Especially since the LHC is in Europe, and that&#039;s where the web was invented.

I admire your enthusiasm!  

There is no centralized database.  That is partly because it isn&#039;t as easy to make one as you suggest.  Sure, some calculations can indeed just be described simply (as in the examples you gave) and for some of these there are lists, though not centralized.  There is a similar list of relatively straightforward experimental analyses that need to be done:

http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2838

So sure, we could make a bigger list for theorists.  It shouldn&#039;t be a problem, except for maintaining it.  It would be very long and always changing.  [There would be some difficulties with people not wanting to reveal what they are working on to their competitors, but let&#039;s ignore that.]

What worries me about the idea is that there are many things that cannot easily be described, certainly not in a few lines.  You&#039;d need a number of paragraphs, or pages, just to illustrate the problem.  And that&#039;s the stuff that typically doesn&#039;t get done. 

Moreover, many of the things that need to be done (&quot;think hard about how to use the data from 2011 to allow us to dig deeper into the 2012 data for challenging signals&quot;) are vague -- they aren&#039;t easily described problems that you can divide up in some obvious way into sub-problems that are so well-specified that a postdoc can just pick one, carry it out, write up the answer and go to the next one.  If I knew what they should calculate, the problem would already be mostly solved.  Often I need a team of people to do a scouting expedition before I can plot the course through the territory.

I could give you many other types of examples... and I&#039;m concerned such a list would be badly biased toward certain classes of problems and leave off very important ones.  It would be a lot of work to keep it properly balanced.

In any case, I don&#039;t think the problem is that we don&#039;t have any way of communicating the problems that exist to the personnel we have.  I&#039;ve been giving talks on this stuff for years now.  The problems are 

1) for many non-glamorous problems, especially ones that can take a year to do, we don&#039;t have enough people who are both able and willing to take them on; putting those problems on a list will not change that.

2) for the most sophisticated and difficult problems, we do not have enough trained personnel at the mid-levels to work effectively with the faculty who actually understand the problem, and we do not have enough faculty at top universities (though this is improving) to train the graduate students who will become the future personnel at the mid-levels.  I don&#039;t think listing the problems would help much with getting those problems done, because nothing you could put in a list would actually explain the subtleties to a less experienced person.  All I could do is write: &quot;come visit me for a couple of weeks and I&#039;ll explain the problem to you.&quot;

But perhaps one of my colleagues disagrees with me, and has the time and energy to set up and maintain a Wiki on which such a list can be made.  While I&#039;m skeptical about its efficacy, I can see it would have some merits, and certainly wouldn&#039;t oppose it being done.

My own personal approach to this problem had been to try to establish a national institute in Large Hadron Collider physics, to serve as a training ground, knowledge repository, and clearing house.  Unfortunately my first (and last) chance to do that was at the end of the Bush administration, and it ran headlong into the 2008 recession.  I do occasionally use this website to raise awareness about what I see as important problems, as I did earlier this year in my discussions of exotic Higgs decays, for instance  https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/
and in disputing claims that somehow supersymmetry had already been excluded back in July of last year.]]></description>

Ok, so let&#039;s fix stuff:

Suppose there was a centralized database of important LHC problems (imagine a spreadsheet, though ultimately it should be a lot more complex.) Column A lists the problem. (eg, compute the following Higgs amplitudes, write code to create the following plots, test these CMS triggers, or whatever.) Column B lists estimated difficulty / skills required.  Column C lists what other items depend on it (recursively of course). Column D lists votes on how important/urgent it is. Yep, you&#039;ll also want to multiply by the voter&#039;s credibility, but that&#039;s easy. Column E lists who&#039;s signed up to solve it, updated with how far they think they&#039;ve got. Column F lists the final solution, and refereed signoff.

Now when a postdoc wants a project, he sorts by Column B and C, and chooses the most important item he&#039;s skilled in that&#039;s not close to being solved by someone he respects much ;). Everyone gets a birds-eye view of what&#039;s needed for various stages of the Higgs Hunt, and what&#039;s holding stuff up. There&#039;s a lot of subjectivity, but the voting will make that ok. Lots of obvious ways to do that. When you&#039;ve done a calculation, just post the raw result. Don&#039;t waste time writing a paper for the arXiv wrapped in a wordy explanation of its importance. Everyone knows why it&#039;s important: It&#039;s line 3243 on The List.
 
And this same list should be made readable by the public. Summarized on the front page, sure, but drillable to an arbitrary level. It&#039;s a spectator sport, right? I assume nobody would claim that group rivalries would make this unworkable. But if so, that&#039;s probably something they&#039;d want to keep very quiet about in this funding climate. ;)

Is there already such a centralized list? If so, what&#039;s the URL please? I&#039;d be really interested to play around with it. ;)
