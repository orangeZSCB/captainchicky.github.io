					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Overbye... Prof. Strassler you overreacted.  Sure the Higgs could be non-standard... epicycles can always be added.  Even the general public understands that... as Sherlock Holmes, well known by the general public pointed out... when you have eliminated all the other possibilities, all that is left is... etc etc.....  but ruling out the simple SM Higgs is a major milestone in that process.

I was very impressed with Overbye&#039;s last paragraph, carefully worded to avoid the misconception that the Higgs is the origin of all mass... QCD provides more mass than the Higgs does in our universe, from massless gluons, itself a fascinating topic much neglected.  And who knows what the origin of the Dark Matter&#039;s mass is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a world where even carefully-written articles by serious physicists often have colleagues chastising them for &quot;gravely misleading the world&quot; in the comments section, I cannot imagine that any article written by a non-scientist, no matter how well-intentioned, could ever really be precise and perfect enough to avoid the criticism of the scientific community.

I would guess that your points are entirely correct, both about the physics and the probable political consequences of those misunderstandings, but short of letting you write the article yourself, I just don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything that a writer with a normal IQ could have done to produce a satisfactory piece.  A newspaper article on advanced physics is not a textbook: it is certainly going to be somewhat wrong, very likely with unfortunate political fallout.  Clearly, the author reads this blog, and did his very, very best to summarize what he thought he knew about the subject with as few errors as he could manage.  What more can you expect?

In short, I wonder if maybe these problems are unavoidable in an era when specialization is the norm and most people inevitably don&#039;t really understand most other people&#039;s professions.

Well, I&#039;m not a physicist.  Sorry if I&#039;m being too bold here...]]></description>

It will not take long to figure this out by measuring angular distributions for the photons.  But I myself have not looked at how long it will take.

More important, if the ratio of the rate for the particle to decay to photons to the rate for it to decay to W and Z particles matches expectations even roughly, that tells you you&#039;re almost certainly looking at a Higgs particle.  It&#039;s difficult (not impossible, but much less plausible) to get those ratios in any other way.]]></description>

It is true that politicians don&#039;t necessarily read the Times.  But the staffers charged with providing them with advice on how to formulate science policy most definitely do.

You&#039;re the first person to complain about the internal links, which are intended to help readers who need background material in order to understand the jargon or technicalities that I&#039;m talking about.  If other readers complain, I&#039;ll stop.]]></description>
