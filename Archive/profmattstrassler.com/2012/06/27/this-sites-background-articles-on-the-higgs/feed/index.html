					<description><![CDATA[Mostly the missing weight that we are all looking for is bond weight between neutrons and protons and they are spinning at light speed so at rest they are lighter. Remember that these subatomic particals are not at rest and there weights are higher then at rest. So it follows that this is the missing weights an not any other subatomic particals other then protons, neutrons, and electrons. I have done the math. Just use the string theorey and you find plenty of same numbers coming up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The market is betting a Higgs will be found; the main uncertainty seems to be about when (the betting is agnostic as to what type of Higgs will be found):
http://www.intrade.com/v4/markets/?eventId=82699

Note however the dates in question are the date a 5-sigma discovery is published in a major journal (for something of this nature I guess that would be Nature/Science/PRL). So one needs to include the time for the peer-review process plus publishing overhead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt, I am so glad I found this blog. You know everything about the Higgs (particle and field) about particle physics in general, the LHC. Furthermore you are explaining everything about physics there is to know. I will not have to visit other blogs and websites any more.  Thank you so much!
