So if the Higgs Field were zero, the electron were massless, and it would travel at c. Is this only true for an electron in a vacuum? Would this massless electron travel at less than c through a medium? 

And to make sure I understand how this currently works for light with our non-zero Higgs Field, which is more correct:

Light travels at c in a vacuum and slower through a medium, i.e. ≈ c/1.3 through water with the exact denominator depending on wavelength?

or:

Light always travels at c but when it&#039;s traveling through water every so often it hits a water molecule and gets absorbed and then later emitted with the average time lost is these absorb/emit interactions ≈ c-c/1.3?]]></description>

How about this ...

1. We live in a 3D universe because three are the minimum dimensions required to create massive particles. 

Why ...

2. I believe there is no such condition as a rest state (zero motion), every joules of energy is in motion (in transition). So when any point of energy expands (high density to low density or visa verse) whether it is the Big Bang or electron-positron annihilation, the process is not spontaneous, as Dirac theorized, put occurs in a finite time intervals, Planck&#039;s time, tp, (or lower?). The energy-time uncertainty principle, Delta-E x Delta-t ~ h, also points to this time interval mechanism, i.e. the time in the energy-time uncertainty is the time interval the quantum state remains the same, unchanged. ...

So ...

If the time interval is not zero then there will be an expansion of &quot;space&quot;, Delta-X ~ Delta-t, i.e. motion and hence velocity. I speculate that c is the velocity that &quot;came out of the wash&quot; at the Big Bang, i.e. proportional to the initial conditions at t = 0. Hence if space (variable energy densities) is expanding at a finite velocity, c, then the distances between the isothermal &quot;rays&quot; will increase and hence create normal rays, the radiation is no longer collimated. It is this mechanism that creates vortices, &quot;rotation&quot; and hence oscillatory waves that lead to standing waves and &quot;massive&quot; particles.

So ...

If I can further my speculation a bit more, I would say as we have seen so far through the SM, quanta, repetitive ans stable states of energy, will exist for the first fundamental &quot;particle&quot; created by the expansion, Higg&#039;s boson.  

Hence, my question to you, Sir. Could the Higg&#039;s boson = Dirac&#039;s particulate aether?]]></description>

The question is somehow not the right one.  

For decades, starting right after the discovery of the electron, people tried to see whether they could come up with a dynamical picture of where the electron&#039;s mass (and corresponding rest-energy, or E=mc^2 energy) comes from.  It wasn&#039;t the right way to think about the problem.

Today we understand the electron&#039;s mass as due to its interaction with the non-zero Higgs field.  If the Higgs field were non-zero, the electron would be massless.  The mass of the electron is more an effect of moving in a medium than it is the effect of somehow getting energy from outside and shoving it into a little container.

Thinking of an electron as a little ball with energy compressed inside it will confuse you badly. There&#039;s no sign of such a picture in the equations.  

I&#039;m still thinking hard about the article I am going to have to write on particles and fields.  Your questions help me see subtleties that I&#039;ll have to explain, somehow...]]></description>

e−  +   e+  →  γ  +  γ

&quot; (Paul Dirac, theorizing electron-positron
annihilation said, “Such process is spontaneous, i.e. it
occurs necessarily for any pair of electron and
positron independently of their energy. The process
does not need any previously existing radiation.”
(Dirac, 1930, Heitler, 1954).) &quot;

&quot;If there is no previously existing radiation and no net linear momentum with the pair electronpositron, then what is the real rest energy of electron 
and positron without association of kinetic energy? &quot; 

Do physicist know how all this energy (electron) can be confined in such a small space? In other words if a fermion is a compressed spring (since the photons shoot out at the speed of light) then what created it and confined it with such stability?]]></description>

Right -- In &lt;strong&gt;tau lepton decay&lt;/strong&gt; you get a limit of 15.5 MeV on the mass of any neutrino thereby emitted.  BUT  a limit does not tell you what the mass is, it just tells you that the mass has to be smaller than this.  

And this is not the strongest existing limit. Limits from cosmology are around an eV.

So Wikipedia is correct (this time), but your conclusion, that the existence of a limit implies there actually is a neutrino whose mass lies at the limit, is logically invalid.]]></description>
