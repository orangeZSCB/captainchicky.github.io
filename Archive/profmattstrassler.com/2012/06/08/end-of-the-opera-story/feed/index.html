I wrote about this in a few places (if you search on my posts on OPERA from March, you&#039;ll see some discussion.)

Ereditato resigned &lt;em&gt;from his position as head of the OPERA experiment&lt;/em&gt; -- not from the experiment himself, which he remains a member of (as far as I know.)  His resignation from the leadership was brought about by the members of the OPERA experiment themselves, many of whom felt, it would appear, that he had led the OPERA experiment into disrepute (possibly endangering its future) by the way the presenting and characterization of the results was handled.  More precisely, many of his collaborators voted against him in a no-confidence vote, and he decided that with so many opposed, it was best that he step down.

Were his collaborators right to be upset with him?  Well, I have seen other scientists handle somewhat similar situations much better than the OPERA leadership did.  And people who lead experiments are expected to handle external politics well; that&#039;s part of their job, as leaders.  If they fail to do so, maybe they should step down and let others take the reins.

But note: Ereditato did not lose his scientific position, nor was he asked to leave the experiment.  

So I think your &quot;romantic&quot; views are still intact.  And somewhat justified.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Professor,
Not unexpected news! however, as the BBC reported on March 30th, professor Ereditato resigned...a story that leaves me with a bitter aftertaste. The OPERA findings were carefully documented and well-aired to the scientific community; why did he have to go? peer-pressure, politics, shame? Any of these choices sadden me. But of course, it could have been any number of reasons.
Still, I have always considered the scientists as our world&#039;s &quot;true bastions&quot; of knightly characteristics with the strength to step aside of  modern vices in the pursuit of truth (to know the how and when if you will). 
As an astrophysicist-to-be I have been encouraged by my professors to hold the practicing of my profession to the highest standards recognized in the scientific community. We could all agree I am not singular to these expectations.
Then, to see somebody in the position of having to resign -as the mentioned article insinuated as a possible reason- perceptibly earthquaked these &quot;romantic&quot; views of mine, maybe because it wouldn&#039;t be uncommon or unheard of but on the contrary.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/06/08/end-of-the-opera-story/#comment-11808&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

The spacetime separation from CERN-GRANSASSO, in t=0, setting c=1,  is given by SÂ²=-\tau^2=(\Delta x)Â²-(\Delta t)Â². The events don&#039;t happen at the same spacetime point. CERN = A, Gran Sasso =B. Firstly, to measure the length (distance) bewteen A and B,an so we have to measure simultaneously two events at CERN and Gran Sasso. t_A=t_B implies X_B-X_A=L from the above formula for the spacetime separation. A beam of light satisfies obviously SÂ²=0, but it does not mean that the time from A to B is zero. You correctly say that \tau, the &quot;proper time&quot; usual definition is that...I agree...But please, see that two space-like separated events, imposing sÂ²=0 imply that 

sÂ²=0=(X_B-X_A)Â²-(t_B-t_A)Â²=0 or equivalently (X_B-X_A)=(t_B-t_A)

This is also your remark, I believe, your x=t stuff. So the &quot;proper time&quot;, or proper time v.2.0 ( if  you like, I think is a question of words/agreement) for light to travel L, reintroducing c, is \t_B =L/c = \tau (not of course the \tau in sÂ²=0 = \tau ^2). Note I was also meaning that the time separation between to events is generally: 

(t_B-t_A)Â²=(X_B-X_A)Â²+\tauÂ²

So, for lightbeams, with standard proper time \tau = 0 the time separation is the minimum possible AND, in our case, it is t=L/c (perhaps I should have not use \tau for that time as well, I think, it is also confusing I recognize, if you are not familiarized with spacetime concepts both my notation and proper time word). I will change it...It can disorient as well...Thanks again...]]></description>

I really don&#039;t think that&#039;s the standard use of the term &quot;proper time&quot;. If an observer sees two events as occurring at the same spatial point --- i.e., if the observer is at rest with respect to those two events --- the time between those events is the ``proper time&#039;&#039;, and satisfies tau^2 = t^2 - x^2 where t and x are the time-separation and position-separation from the point of view of any other inertial observer.  (I&#039;m setting c to 1.)  That means that for an observer traveling with a light beam --- for which t and x are always equal, from the point of view of any inertial observer --- tau = 0.

Good luck on the financial side.]]></description>

It is probably a second-order effect: 

in the notation of  https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/  , 

the electron mass arises from an interaction of the form electron-right--Higgs field -- electron-left

the neutrino mass MAY arise in a similar way if neutrino-right fields exist, OR

it MAY arise from an interaction of the form neutrino-left* -- (Higgs field)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -- neutrino-left

The latter interaction would be induced by some as yet unknown higher-energy phenomenon (there are many possibilities and the mere existence of the interaction doesn&#039;t tell you which possibility is right.)

Here&#039;s a short technical review: http://www.physics.upenn.edu/neutrino/jhu/node2.html]]></description>
