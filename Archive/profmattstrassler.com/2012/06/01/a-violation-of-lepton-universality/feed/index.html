Bell&#039;s theorem is just not relevant here.  

And Mr. Rosen&#039;s work is one of thousands of similar probably misguided attempts... at most one of which (and probably zero of which) is correct.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bell&#039;s theorem is related to the foundations of quantum theory, which might be relevant to the existence of the Higgs field and also to every aspect of the Standard Model of particle physics. Is the Higgs field necessary for explaining the masses of the leptons and quarks? According to Prof. (Emeritus) Gerald Rosen of Drexel U., “All lepton and quark masses appear directly related to the electron mass.”

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, as usual.
Just a little correction: you mention that lepton universality e/tau has been checked experimentally in W decays to a good precision, but there&#039;s actually a long standing 2-3 sigma deviation between experiment (mainly LEP) and the lepton universality predicted by the standard model. See arXiv:1203.2092 for a recent review on this issue.]]></description>
