					<description><![CDATA[This &quot;collision&quot; of Information (&quot;Scholarly Scrutiny&quot;) &#038; Entertainment (&quot;Pop Culture&quot; as per Chemistry Nobelist Dr Roald Hoffman/Cornell) repeats itself in many professions.

Commentary on Environmental Films (from mailing list for the American Society for Environmental History (ASEH) )

http://bit.ly/QuEVIe

See comments by historians James Lewis &#038; Dr Hal Rothman/UNLV (my high-school classmate BTW), they echo what Matt is saying..Media lacks Scholarly Scrutiny

====
At the WHA in 1992, I had an interesting discussion with Paul Steckler 
&#062; (*Last Stand at Little Bighorn*) and Larry Hott, who made both *The 
&#062; Wilderness Idea* and *Wild by Law.*  They evinced in essence an auteur 
&#062; theory of documentary--that they would &quot;research&quot; material and present it 
&#062; in the way they saw fit.  I said fine--as long as their primary 
&#062; commitment was to a a fair and balanced view of the past as the past. I 
&#062; came away persuaded that they had other intentions.
&#062; 
&#062; This is not an argument against using these films; it is merely an 
&#062; argument against uncritically accepting them.  I use them, but I 
&#062; interpret them too.  Too much of the perspective they include does not bear 
&#062; scholarly scrutiny.  Both are attractively done films, dotted with many of 
&#062; our colleagues--most of who say typically inteleligent things--, but the 
&#062; authoring sensibility in my opinion is not true to the past; rather its frame 
&#062; of reference is the present and the iconography and culture of our time 
&#062; in the same manner that journalists use out-of-context history to support 
&#062; their arguments. 
&#062; 
&#062; I suppose I should now argue that historians make their own films and 
&#062; maybe we should; I think its more realistic for us to try to influence 
&#062; the filmmakers--having tried, I know that this is harder than it 
&#062; appears--leaving us with the dilemma of being included in films that 
&#062; don&#039;t accurately reflect our understanding of the past--and thereby 
&#062; legitimizing them by our presence--or staying out and sometimes cringing at 
&#062; the results.  Its a postmodern no-break even!
&#062; 
&#062; Hal Rothman
&#062; UNLV
========

Matt &#038; Hal are basically saying the same thing, their scholarship doesn&#039;t coincide with the &quot;media angle&quot;..oversimplificiation &#038; some manipulation.

========
A film cannot show everything nor reach the depths of 
understanding found in a book or even an article, and filmmakers fall prey to 
the need to make it captivating for the viewer.  A historically accurate 
film that bores and goes unwatched is worthless in this sense.  The same 
criticisms lobbed at Oliver Stone and Spike Lee for their manipulation of 
history to get across their point is only what the public hears about, 
but similar scrutiny should be cast on film documentaries as well.  
Ken Burns&#039; &quot;Baseball&quot; came under criticism mostly for its length in the 
general press.  But Ken Oberman of ESPN, a knowledgable baseball person but 
not a historian in the conventional sense, kept a running tally of factual 
and visual errors, and found well in excess of over 100 at the half-way mark 
of the film. Similar criticisms have only recently emerged in regards to 
his &quot;Civil War&quot; series.  So even the most respected of documentarians is 
subject to this flaw,and his work should be studied closely for flaws 
just like anyone else&#039;s.

	I can no longer watch a documentary without questioning it, which is 
the way it should be anyhow.  When using them in the classroom, the points I&#039;ve
 raised here should be kept in mind.  They may also serve as the basis or 
starting point for a historigraphic debate about the issue, as well as a 
way to teach critical thinking. Too often, students accept what&#039;s on 
television as the absolute truth, much as they often do with any other sources.

A film is, after all, just another secondary source and should be treated as
such. 

	Caveat Viewer!

James Lewis
======

&quot;Facts tell [ Science ], but Stories [ Entertainment ]  sells&quot;
-- Auto Racing maxim (or any field, for that matter)

Look at how NASCAR became the 2nd watched Sport on Television behind Football, leaping over Baseball (USA national pasttime).  The BORING racing in circles, was given a Business Model (&quot;Billboard on 4 wheels&quot;) along with an Entertainment Model (&quot;Soap Opera on 4 wheels&quot;, driver rivalries creating huge fandoms).  Lots of &quot;bad boy&quot; drivers like Tony Stewart, Kyle &#038; Kurt Busch that attract attention.  Something Physics could learn from: lack of funding &#038; boring subject (with boring scientists).  The success of &quot;The BIg Bang Theory&quot; (2nd most popular SITCOM..12 million viewers per week) came from the colorful character (&quot;bad boy&quot;) -- string theorist Dr Lubos Motl.

There is an interesting paradox, how to project the complex intellectual nature of XXX (Physics, Enivronmental History, etc) to the XXX-challenged Public.  I read somewhere that some archaeologists were inspired by the popular CRACKPOT Erik von Daniken (&quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot;), similar to the &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; kook Graham Hancock (&quot;Ancient Civilizations&quot;).  Then we have the &quot;God Particle&quot; thing that the Publishers pushed on Leon Lederman.  Publishers want to sell copy &#038; make $$.  R. Feynman had a similar experience when he found an error in a text (&quot;Energy makes the toy car go&quot;..NO, it&#039;s Energy Transfer), &#038; confronted the Publisher..NOTHING HAPPENED!

So, Matt..welcome to the club.  Dr Roald Hoffman/Cornell, R. Feynman/Caltech, et al.  &quot;Dealing with the Public&quot; can be frustrating!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“The power of the Press relies on the Ignorance of the Masses”

Perfect example of a journalist (Graham Hancock) delving into Science..pure CRACKPOTTERY

http://amzn.to/MUdfM0

This book has triggered a 3-part Discovery Channel episode, that joins the other kook programs (aliens, Bigfoot, conspiracy theories, etc)..TV version of Tabloids (junk entertainment).

Sample Amazon review:

“Everyone who gave this book one star should realize that this book is entertainment. Hancock is not a scientist or an academic of any kind – he’s a journalist! … Of course Hancock tailors the facts to fit his theories – he is not constrained by truth, science, or even ethics. He is a journalist. …This book, and all those like it that preach pseudo-science, appeal to the majority of people in this world who are scientifically challenged. Most Americans don’t have enough scientific knowledge to understand the technology they face everyday, much less untangle the fact and fantasy in this book. It is entertainment, but it’s dangerous – science interpreted by a journalist!” – review of “Fingerprints of the Gods”

“As a matter of fact I heard a proponent of this story on a local radio station on Wednesday morning. Within five minutes this gentleman [ G. Hancock ] uttered bits and pieces of every crackpot doomsday comet theory (some borrowed from Comet Lee nonsense) and loony bin alien conspiracy tale imaginable.” – D. Mitsky, Penn State

Look at how Scientific American &#038; Sky&#038;Telescope (once affiliation with Harvard Observatory) have degraded, it reflects the Market..dumbed-down Public.

“me &#038; my friends call S&#038;T [ Sky &#038; Telescope ], the National Sky Enquirer” – Dr. Jay Freeman, amateur astronomer (UC Berkeley PhD, Particle Physics)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/06/25/a-last-stand-but-whose/#comment-12435&quot;&gt;aa. sh.&lt;/a&gt;.

Sorry you aren&#039;t getting the answers you wanted.  Let&#039;s see if I can answer your questions.

1. Charge is the quantity that represents the strength of an object&#039;s interaction with the electromagnetic field.
2. Maxwell&#039;s equations are the relationship between electric charge amd the electromagnetic field.  To put it in simplified English terms, a charge creates an electric field around it, a moving charge creates a magnetic field around it, an electric field causes a charge to move, and a magnetic field causes a charge to turn.  That is the relationship between the charge and the field.
3. I don&#039;t quite understand your question about frequencies and amplitudes, but maybe the answer you&#039;re looking for is electromagnetic waves.
4. I don&#039;t think I understand what you mean by &quot;causal power&quot;, either, but maybe your question is answered in #2.
5. Sorry you&#039;re having trouble finding what you&#039;re looking for.  There are a huge number of resources throughout the internet to explain these things.  You could try looking up &quot;electromagnetic field&quot; on Wikipedia in your own language.  Also, there are other places online you can get questions answered, too, such as physicsforums.com.

Hope that helps.]]></description>
