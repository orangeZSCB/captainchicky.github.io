Can I only make a new entry or can I remove one from the list, that should not be there, too ... :-P ?
Prof. Strassler of course belongs to the list on nice bloggers, good idea :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For those who are fans of govt. support of scientific research, one small thing to do might be to create a Strassler wikipedia entry. Many physics bloggers, e.g. Lubos Motl, Sean Carroll, Clifford Johnson, Peter Woit, Jacques Distler, are already in wikipedia. Go to

					<description><![CDATA[...similar to venture capital investments in many small startup companies; most of these efforts will fail...

I think it&#039;s hard to make the analogy that the LHC is a &quot;small startup company&quot;. If the idea is to fund lots of small and varied projects, wouldn&#039;t it make better sense to spread the money around to many different labs, each working on very different research? In physics terms, your could fund hundreds -- if not thousands -- of small independent teams of condensed-matter, chemical, biological, optical etc physicists all for the price of the LHC.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I come from a particular point of view in saying that science is too expensive for the public to fund without clear justification, which is difficult when we need funding to test hypotheses that by definition carry risk of failure. It all becomes peicemeal unless there is allocation across a spectrum according to a complete overview of science. However, there is no overview because science is not yet unified in theory, for allocation, and we are left with competing claimants. Allocation becomes a scientific process in itself.

Until science has greater unity and therefore capacity to value and prioritize between alternatives, I would fund social services first and science a distant second. Thankfully, I have recently unified science in my book at www.thehumandesign.net (its a non spiritual geometrical Design to unify the four forces). Sadly, I am not a scientist, so even the unification is not really yours, it belongs to a lay person. That speaks to the problems of current science.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stop the pipe dream nonsense, human spaceflight program, and you will have plenty of research money to cover all sciences across the board.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/06/22/why-government-investment-is-worthwhile/#comment-12330&quot;&gt;hibida&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;d have to disagree about risk appetite.  The private sector has a very high risk premium.  Meaning, they expect to be highly compensated, quickly, for any risky investments they make.  If you look at PE or VC projections, they want to make 20-50% annualized returns on their investment.  How much research can really claim that sort of return even in best-case scenarios?  A lot of fundamental research has payoffs that might be decades in the making (and hard to monetize), and there is simply no investor who is willing to bear risk that long.

Government is the ideal source of funds for the sort of research with long-term, perhaps indirect, benefits.  Governments have very large budgets and so can bear risk through diversification.  They also have no need to directly monetize the research--the payout is the benefit to society, without a need to convert it back into dollars.

It may be true that not enough worthy, risky research is getting funded, but I think that&#039;s a problem of budget and not a problem with a taxpayer-funded model.  If the budget is too small, capacity for risk through diversification is reduced.  Not to mention, it&#039;s very expensive to *evaluate* high-risk projects.  If the budget is strained, one of the first responses will be to be more conservative with the available funding, and perhaps that&#039;s what&#039;s happened.]]></description>

I completely understand this objection and I too suspect that greater knowledge of the Higgs will likely never bring us great technological advance (or at least, not in the near future). But I also suspect this is the wrong question to ask - that the benefits of pure science will in the future descend less directly from the science itself, but will still be inextricably linked to the research which bore it. Just as CERN brought us the web, and the space programme brought numerous technological spin-offs, I&#039;m sure pure inspirational science of the future will reward us in ways we cannot now predict, but which stem directly from its pursuit (indeed, just as times of war always bring us medical advances). Apart from anything else, you can&#039;t bracket off different areas of physics, or even science as a whole, and treat them as isolated avenues of study - the different disciplines will always talk to each other and augment each other&#039;s development. Matt is right to note that this is a horse race in which you can&#039;t pick the winner before it starts, but the truth is bolder than that - whatever winners there are will emerge stronger from the participation of all the others.]]></description>
