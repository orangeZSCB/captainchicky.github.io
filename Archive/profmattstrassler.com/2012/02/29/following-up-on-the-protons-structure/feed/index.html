					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/29/following-up-on-the-protons-structure/#comment-19202&quot;&gt;Prab&lt;/a&gt;.

Some good questions.

Just because several things cancel out on average, does not mean they are not there; if my feet are in an oven and my head in a freezer, it is not the same as being at room temperature. This is called &#039;dynamic equilibrium&#039; and the world is made of it. A cup of water does not appear to do anything; it just sits there. Yet all of its molecules are in constant motion, a dust grain in water jerks about wildly as it is hit on all sides. The same is true of the proton, the &#039;other&#039; particles would all cancel out... if they were all in the same place. But they&#039;re not, they&#039;re all over the place within the proton. On average they wouldn&#039;t exist, but they never manage to average out, indeed they cannot ever average out.

We know there are 3 quarks in excess because while in the proton things don&#039;t average out, far from it they do. Think of your computer screen. it is made up of three colors of pixels that combine together to make whatever colors you see. Imagine watching a movie on it. Up close all you would see is a sea of pixels, red blue green, you could try counting them to see what color they&#039;d make, but they&#039;d be changing so fast you&#039;d have no hope. But zoom out now to the scale of the screen and you can clearly see the average color. You can take a patch of screen and knowing that it is yellow state with confidence that there is an excess of red and green pixels. Indeed a single measurement of the average color will tell you exactly what proportions the three colors are in.

A proton is the same, seeing it from afar we see the average, even though that average is just due to how we&#039;re looking at it.

I hope this helps answer your question.]]></description>

Thanks for the response and sorry to have come back late.

Although I very much appreciate your answer I also see some probems with it. First, if the rest of the fundamental particles cancel each other out then they can&#039;t be there at all, right? Or if you mean to imply how electrons and protons cancel each other out in neutral atoms but isotopes can be distingushed we are still left with an uncertainty as per my question. So how do we know there are 3 quarks in excess?

Second, adding water to 3 teaspoonful of sugar analogy is problematic because both of thse quantities are measureable, controllerable and definite, whereas the gluons and quarks are something we&#039;re trying to measure.]]></description>

Virtual photons are rare, but they are in there.  But for one of those photons to be real and escape the proton, there would have to a way for the proton to emit a photon without violating energy and momentum conservation... and that&#039;s not possible.  The process proton --&#062; proton + photon violates energy momentum conservation no matter how you try to distribute energy and momentum among the particles. Meanwhile, te decay proton --&#062; photon + something-else is disallowed too, because, by the various conservation laws (energy, momentum, electric charge, and &quot;quark&quot; [i.e. &quot;baryon&quot;] number (the last of which may be approximate but violated only by an extremely tiny amount), there is no allowed ``something-else&#039;&#039;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another brilliant piece.

I am curious though, what stops quarks and antiquarks colliding and producing photons? There&#039;s always enough energy for that to happen. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s because the proton is the lowest energy assembly of the particles involved so that anything producing non-strong force feeling particles would require energy and thus be impossible, but I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s right.]]></description>

Because the &#039;other&#039; particles all cancel out. you can think of it as adding three spoonfuls of sugar to a cup of water. I may not know how much water is there, I can add more water, or let some evaporate, but I am SURE of the three spoonfuls of sugar being in there somewhere.

The three &#039;extra&#039; quarks are what determines many of the proton&#039;s properties, such as its electric charge. (Just as the spoonfuls of sugar would determine how sweet the water tasted.)

We can&#039;t pin them down or separate them, but we know they must be &#039;in there somewhere.&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I worded my question badly; the question should have be worded this way:  &quot; . . . then what force is it that holds all the positive charges of the protons together to form, along with  neutrons, the nucleus itself?

I hope I&#039;m being clear.

BTW: let me join the list of appreciative readers.  You have a kind of a &quot;nuts-and-bolts&quot; approach that somehow still manages to achieve significant (we all know you&#039;re keeping it rather simple) depth.  So, thanks.  I&#039;m learning a lot; and, quite easily.]]></description>
