					<description><![CDATA[The wiki page for partons suggests that for collisions involving a small amount of energy or momentum, then protons act like they only have 3 particles. But if the energy or momentum is very high, then protons act like they have many particles. Is this the result of the Uncertainty Principle?  So the higher the momentum involved in the entire proton/proton collision, the less time the entire collision takes place, and the greater the effect virtual particles have?]]></description>

I&#039;m afraid that the QCD condensate (which you should read up on) won&#039;t tell you much about nucleon structure, only about nucleon existence.

The QCD condensate is a non-zero value for a composite spin-zero field made from a quark field and an antiquark field.

The Higgs condensate is a non-zero value for an (apparently-)elementary spin-zero field, not made from anything that we know of.  But technicolor is the idea that the Higgs field is composite in analogy with QCD.

The Higgs and QCD condensates are remarkably similar not only in their rough structure but also in their precise quantum numbers.  If there were no Higgs field in nature, the QCD condensate would still form &lt;em&gt;(we think; but let me not go into this subtlety, which has to do with how QCD with six light quarks behaves)&lt;/em&gt; and would break electroweak symmetry just as the Higgs does, leading to (small) masses for the W and Z particles.  [However the QCD condensate would not give mass to the electron, and all of the quarks would be very light, including even the top quark.]  That&#039;s why technicolor is such a great idea; it suggests that the Higgs condensate forms in a way which is analogous to how the QCD condensate forms.  But technicolor appears to be very strongly disfavored by the observation of a light-weight Higgs-like particle, as well as by comparing precision measurements and calculations.]]></description>

I&#039;m guessing it is the QCD condensate I need to read up on to understand the structure of a nucleon. 

Is it reasonable to think of the higgs field as a condensate?]]></description>

You&#039;re still a little bit mixed up; let me try to set it straight.

1) in the Standard Model, which includes QCD (the theory of quarks and gluons) the *prediction* for the electron&#039;s electric dipole moment is 10^−38 e·cm.  That is too small to measure.  The best measurements are only able to exclude a dipole moment a hundred billion times larger.   Therefore, not observing an electric dipole moment for the electron with current experiments is consistent with the Standard Model and poses no problems whatsoever for the theory, including its description of quarks and gluons.

2) if the Standard Model is not complete and new particles must be added to it, these new particles (through quantum effects involving virtual particles) can cause a much larger electric dipole moment for the electron.  The fact that no electric dipole moment has yet been observed implies that certain of the various speculative ideas about various new particles are wrong.  But there are many, many variants of most of these ideas, including supersymmetry.  Some of them predict a large electric dipole moment, but others do not.  All we learn from current experiments is that some variants of these ideas can be discarded, but many still remain. 

So -- no problems with the Standard Model; some powerful but incomplete constraints on speculative ideas that go beyond the Standard Model; and nothing definitive on its own.  This is not unusual; typically several different measurements are needed for real insights to be obtained.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess I misunderstood what was being said. The speaker (Ed Copeland) was talking about a dipole moment for the electron which was caused by quarks, but virtual quarks, and at 10^−38 e·cm. Which is a lot smaller than they were looking. I thought that them not finding a dipole moment meant that there was something wrong with QCD and the quarks in the proton. He did say it is bad news for SQCD as some aspects of supersymetry predict currently unseen particles that should cause a dipole moment at the sensitivity they were probing. Hope I got is right this time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a lecture I watched online the lecturer said that the two up quarks(+2/3, + 2/3) and a down quark(-1/3) that make the positive charge of a proton, according to QCD, should cause a spherical deviation or lack of roundness of the electron charge. I was asking if the observed roundness or lack of spherical deviation in the electron charge was evidence that there was a problem with by QCD?]]></description>
