					<description><![CDATA[What i do not realize is in fact how you&#039;re not really a lot more neatly-appreciated than you might be now.
You&#039;re so intelligent. Yoou reccognize therefore significantly on the subject of this topic, made 
mme for my part believe it from numerous numerous angles.
Its like men and women aren&#039;t interested except it&#039;s one 
thing to do with Girl gaga! Your individual stuffs excellent.
At all times deal with it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found this interview with Prof. Antonio Ereditato, dated one day in march 2012. He spoke to Frontline in Chennai when he was visiting the Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Here is the full interview concerning the OPERA result and the two possible errors the collaboration informed about in february:

					<description><![CDATA[For any M-theorists reading this: The point is as follows: M-theory predicts gravity, non-abelian gauge theory, and SUSY. M-theory with the infinite nature hypothesis predicts SUSY in the form of particles, some of which explain dark matter. M-theory with the finite nature hypothesis predicts SUSY in the form of symmetry principles within Wolfram&#039;s automaton. When Fernández-Rañada explained the Pioneer anomaly as anomalous gravitational acceleration of clocks, he ignored M-theory and MOND. If you study his analysis and assume that both M-theory and MOND are correct, then you get the Rañada-Milgrom effect, at least approximately.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt: Thank you for being very patient with me. My impression is that Steven Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow think that I am a crackpot (THEY COULD BE CORRECT!). It might be that Prof. Fernández-Rañada regards me as a crackpot. See http://vixra.org/pdf/1203.0016v1.pdf “Anomalous Gravitational Acceleration and the OPERA Neutrino Anomaly (Updated)”.
In reply to an e-mail query, Professor Glashow kindly provided (Nov. 18, 2011 CE) a list of 31 questions:
“1) why is the sm group su(3)xsu(2)xu(1)?
2) why are there 6 quarks?
3) why are there 6 leptons?
4-13) why are quark masses and mixings what they are?
14-23) why are lepton masses and mixings what they are?
24-26) why are the three gauge couplings what they are?
27) what&#039;s the origin of neutrino masses?
28) Is there a std. model higgs boson? where?
29) what breaks electroweak symmetry?
30) why is the cosmological const so small?
31) are neutrinos superluminal?”
I strongly believes that question 31 is answered in the negative and completely explained by the Rañada-Milgrom effect.]]></description>
