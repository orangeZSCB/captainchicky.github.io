					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/18/the-constancy-of-the-heavens-verified-anew/#comment-37402&quot;&gt;Vincent Sauve&lt;/a&gt;.

While it is true that radiation can power a system and allow it to reduce its entropy, it can never reduce that system&#039;s entropy by more than th entropy *gain* in creating that radiation.

Our planet gets energy from the sun&#039;s radiation, and emits lower energy, higher entropy infared and radio radiation. This can be used by a far smaller number of processes which mostly emit very low energy radio waves.

The energy from our collapsing solar system and indeed our sun currently is high entropy in two ways. firstly a lot of it is low energy and secondly it is very dilute. This is why it is unlikely there is life on gas giant moons (Those not being heated by a totally different process, tidal forces.); there simply is not enough energy density to reduce the local entropy.

Indeed it is very hard to think of what use radiation emitted by our solar system could be, we receive the radiation from billions of similar systems, or stars, and starlight, even that of stars the human eye can see, is very faint.

My third paragraph applies to all physical systems, the solar system is just an example. If we move up to the universe as a whole, we have yet to observe any process that inserts energy into a system. The mass in our galaxy is slowly but surely falling into its center, the stars are converting mass into dilute radiation that spreads into the intergalactic void and in general things are running down. There is no place in the universe I am aware of where &#039;new&#039; universe is being created.

Matter (If you count all particles as matter.) in motion is indeed eternal (Photons for one can never not be in motion.) but this is different from saying that that motion can do useful work.  Matter at absolute zero still moves to some degree, but cannot ever reduce the entropy of a system. (Though it makes a great heat sink.)

The fact that stars do not have an infinite lifetime is not really a problem for the paradox; if the universe is infinitely old than an infinite number of them have existed in any given area, emitting an infinite amount of energy. If I light my house all night with one lightbuld, or replace the bulb every hour, I still use the same amount of energy. I do however admit that some of your sources make some far better arguments, though I am not convinced by them.

I am curious as to why you believe only material objects can expand. If you have a situation where any two objects move apart at speeds relative to the distance between them then what you have is equivalent to expanding space. (It may well be a property of the objects, but it is equivalent.) Of course the error may be in thinking of empty space as nothing; for &#039;nothing&#039; it sure has a lot of properties.

Frankly I am not a fan of inflation, the theory if shot full of holes. But I have yet to see a compelling argument for the infinite universe either. The wonderful thing about science however is that you simply cannot hide the truth. Eventually those who back a wrong theory will become the science denying ideologues like those who clutter climate change and the age of the earth.

What I would like to see is a black dwarf, if anything would prove conclusively our universe is older than we think it would be that. (Or of course a burned out brown dwarf, likely to be much, much more common.)]]></description>

My apologies in that last post. I didn&#039;t mean to completely paste Kudzu&#039;s statement ahead of mine. I was using his full statement for reference in iPad Notes while I was composing my reply and when I cut and pasted, Kudzu&#039;s statement went along with the ride. So my name appears on top of his statement followed by my statement.

Ah, your example is a neat one but there are some problems with it. Our solar system today is quite ordered, but it is not more ordered than the primordial dust cloud when we take into account all of the radiation emitted by the cloud and sun over 4.6 billion years.

As the cloud shrank and ordered it lost gravitational energy in the form of heat, as well as flinging not an insignificant amount of mass out in the form of first gas, then dust then entire planets as things settled down. We are surrounded by a gigantic shell of emitted energy and mass. Order in one place has been compensated by greater disorder in another, like a fridge getting cooler as its motor warms the outside air.

So our solar system is constantly shedding disorder until our sun burns out and grows cold and crystalline. (Then even the planets will shed gravitational energy until the solar system is just one central object, the lowest possible energy state.) The only possible way for our solar system to be eternal is for some mechanism to continuously lower the entropy of it. (The simplest method would be to convert helium back into hydrogen spontaneously, adding energy to the sun, but it wouldn’t help the rest of the system.)

This is in fact part of the earlier ‘steady state’ theories, that new stars and mass kept appearing to replace that which burned out. It also ran into he problem that if the universe was infinitely old (and maybe large.) that all of space would have reached equilibrium with the stars, wherever we looked we would see starlight from some star or other and thus the sky would be as bright as the surface of the sun. this is known as Olber’s paradox: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox

Kudzu

The high entropy disordered state of the primordial pre solar system dust cloud collapsed due to a shock from a nearby supernova (as I recall reading about). After the initial perturbation, gravity did the rest to collapse the cloud and create a low entropy more ordered system of revolving and rotating relatively compact bodies. 

The radiation emitted by the collapsed system doesn&#039;t negate the observation that it was the action of gravity that resulted in a lower entropy system. Yes, the radiation carries off the difference in entropy, but that radiation is not lost in an infinite universe, it can be reused in ways that can create low entropy systems. The portion of radiation our biosphere receives from our sun powers all kinds of neat chemical and biological responses that create lower entropy states. 

Since we don&#039;t really know what causes gravity (except to say most likely it is the result of an induced imbalance of a microcosm of impinging bodies that have inertia) we should keep an open mind that maybe that radiation has something to do with the phenomenon of gravitation. 

(Saying that gravity is the result of space-time curvature and that space-time curvature is caused by mass doesn&#039;t really explain gravity, especially since the equivalence principle shows us that we don&#039;t need a massive body to produce the gravitational space-time curvature effect; just a rocket engine will do or other kind of acceleration that isn&#039;t of the free-fall type.)

Your third paragraph seems to imply that I said or implied that the solar system could be or should be eternal. Structured systems in the universe are not eternal in any realistic model. What is eternal in an infinite universe is matter in motion.

Your fourth paragraph refers to Olber&#039;s Paradox. That would be a problem to explain but isn&#039;t because luminous stars do not have an infinite lifetime. For more details about that see the front page of my website critiquing the supporting assumptions for the Big Bang theory.

Thank you Kudzu, 
&quot;Gravity reverses entropy&quot; - at least in our piece of universe, where dark matter gravity(quantum?) exists ? 
&quot;The only possible way for our solar system to be eternal is for some mechanism to continuously lower the entropy of it&quot; - Dark energy lowers the entropy by keeping apart gravitational  collision at quantum gravity - thus creating mass, re-energize or lower entropy ? 

Unlike discrete digital information, Quantum information( physical information) cannot be cloned, the state may be in a superposition of basis values. The ability to manipulate quantum information enables us to perform tasks that would be unachievable in a classical context, such as unconditionally secure transmission of information. 
However, despite this, the amount of information that can be retrieved in a single qubit is equal to one bit. It is in the processing of information (quantum computation) that the differentiation occurs - means...
We can only retrieve the 3D mirror image - like in 3-D printing technology ? -  http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/3d-printing-technology-poised-for-new-industrial-revolution-a-874833.html 

To process &quot;fermion&quot; level Physical information( quantum information) in  quantum entanglement, Yukawa interaction should occur - like between, Higgs field and massless quark and lepton fields ?]]></description>

The problem is I am not sure there *is* a signal between entangled objects; from what I have read when one particle is altered the other is too, instantaneously, and there is no signal sent between them. I could be wrong, which is why I should much like he Professor&#039;s opinion on the subject.

At base a signal is simply something being sent from one point to another. This may be a solid object like a letter, a particle either boson or fermion, or a ripple in a field. All that is required is that something exist that is moving from one place to another.

As the professor has discussed elsewhere on this site, the definition of &#039;matter&#039; can be difficult; if you&#039;re defining it as fermions then it is entirely possible for them to have a physical effect. We can turn particles like neutrons into waves, split and reflect them and bounce them off of each other. There is a rich array of fermion-fermion interactions that are definitely &#039;physical effects&#039;.]]></description>

Thank you Kudzu,
Two photons = (photon)^2 = feel mass inside a closed system.
Also true for (nothing)^2 =   feel mass inside a closed system - because Higgs &quot;vev&quot; going and coming out of closed systems. 
What make them contained in a closed system ?

It is simple in nucleons contained in a closed system - if we split them by external energy, they release enormous binding energy calculated by E = mc^2. 
For going and coming out of a closed system need enormous energy, even for spin zero ?

Can we say, E(dark energy) = m (nothing)^2 ? 
So anti gravity(dark energy) is inversely proportional to non zero &quot;nothing&quot; (Higgs vev) ?
So we could feel the mass or physical effect(the quantum action) ? 

The feeling of mass = nothing^2 - is a belief(consciousness). This belief has been an intrinsic or quantized genetic code - preserved by Quantum entanglement - so it is same in different space time for different observers ?]]></description>

Kudzu, if you can imagine that the universe is not expanding, that the cosmological redshift is due to another effect (besides expanding space) and hence, no need for a Big Bang beginning or ad hoc fixes like inflation, apparently your only other objection is entropy. But that is not a real problem. Gravity reverses entropy. The &quot;law&quot; of entropy is only true if one excludes the effects of gravity. That is precisely what the originators of &quot;law&quot; of increasing entropy have done. Gravity was ignored because the scale of which the originators of that &quot;law&quot; worked with didn&#039;t have gravity as a significant effect. 

As an example, our solar system evolved from highly disordered state, under the influence of gravity, to a relatively ordered state where more energy is available to do work. (Place a solar panel anywhere in our solar system 5 billion or more years ago when it was just a nebula of dust and gas and see how much energy your solar cells could produce versus what can happen today!).]]></description>
