					<description><![CDATA[[...] Ok, everyone; by now you&#8217;ve all learned that the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] announced recently their measurement of the mass of the Higgs particle, in its decay to two photons, is at 126.6±0.3±0.7 GeV/c²; and meanwhile they measure the mass for apparently the same particle, in its decay to two lepton/anti-lepton pairs, to be 123.5±0.9+0.4-0.2 GeV/c². &#8220;So bizarre&#8221;, wrote Michael Moyer at Scientific American,  bandying about the idea that there are two Higgs-like bosons in this data (though he then, having pointed out the ambulance to you, tells you later that you shouldn&#8217;t chase it&#8230; neglecting also to mention CMS&#8217;s data from November that directly disfavors this interpretation of the ATLAS data.)

					<description><![CDATA[I do not see any problem in Scientific American’s article, no silliness about it. I do see a big under current about this Higgs story.

a. In the July 2012 announcement, it did not claim that the new particle is a Higgs.
b. On 16 October 2012,   in the article “The Inner Life of Quarks, by Don Lincoln, Scientific American”, it discussed a long dead idea of preons.
c. In the 13 November 2012 reports (almost 5 months after the initial report), CERN did not confirm that the new particle is a Higgs. At the same time, SUSY received a deadly blow by the LHCb data.
d. In the 13 December 2012 report, Atlas reported the problems in the Higgs data.
e. On December 14, 2012, in the article “Have Scientists Found Two Different Higgs Bosons?, by Michael Moyer, Scientific American)”, it hints that the Higgs is in trouble.

The above is not a good trend for Higgs. Instead of being silliness, Scientific American is seemingly knows something which we do not know about. Yet, we do (at least, should) know the simple physics fact.
i. SUSY is the extension of Higgs. If SUSY is out, the Higgs alone cannot survive.
ii. Whatever SUSY is, it must have a tail sitting right around the weak-scale. If not, it is disjointed from “this” universe and cannot be a part of “this” physics. Let it be the physics of the “other” universe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice clarification of another nonsense in the Scientific American :-)
Maybe they should stop writing about particle physics, if they are not able to do it correctly (and unbiased too sometimes)...

What is most upsetting is  that it is always the scientists, who have done nothing wrong but honestly reported or talked about their results (maybe even at a scientific conference that was NOT intended for a wider public in some cases?), who get the blame from the public, if science journalists overdo it, are not careful enough, or even make up or distort things to sell a better story.]]></description>
