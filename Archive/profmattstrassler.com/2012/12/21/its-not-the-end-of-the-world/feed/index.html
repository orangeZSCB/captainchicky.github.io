					<description><![CDATA[WMAP Team Releases Final Results, Based on Nine Years of Observations: 
WMAP observations also support an add-on to the big bang framework to account for the earliest moments of the universe. Called “inflation,” the theory says that the universe underwent a dramatic early period of expansion, growing by more than a trillion trillion-fold in less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second. Tiny fluctuations were generated during this expansion that eventually grew to form galaxies.
Remarkably, WMAP’s precision measurement of the properties of the fluctuations has confirmed specific predictions of the simplest version of inflation:  the fluctuations follow a bell curve with the same properties across the sky, and there are equal numbers of hot and cold spots on the map. WMAP also confirms the  predictions that the amplitude of the variations in the density of the universe on big scales should be slightly larger than smaller scales, and that the universe should obey the rules of Euclidean geometry so the sum of the interior angles of a triangle add to 180 degrees- ie... the universe is  three dimensional. 

Where there is matter, there is dark matter,  that has gravity but does not emit any light. So light(photons) also locked inside closed system of dark matter(during inflation)- like, Gold stone bosons locked inside matter, creating rest mass?
 
Higgs boson(h) create graviton at lower energy level, outside the closed system of matter(for a while). We cannot differentiate this with Neutrino oscillation- while it behave as Higgs boson of dark matter, acquire it mass from “dark energy”- thus neutralizing the effect of expansion of the space, from matter explosion?. 
Analogy: When baking a cake, the distance between raisins go apart. If raisins were replaced by small stones, will be more intact(matter not the space) during baking(from acceleration of the expansion of the universe)???]]></description>

1) I wasn&#039;t referring to you (as should be obvious if you read closely.)  I was referring to informal proof-readers, not to standard readers like yourself.

2) You do not do a writer any favors by failing to point out even minor errors.  Editing is generally appreciated.  It is extremely difficult, when writing several thousand words a week, to avoid errors, and no one gains if errors remain in the text.

3) There are no &quot;minor&quot; spelling mistakes.]]></description>
