i don&#039;t have the background or been taught how to read your data graphs so i don&#039;t know what the rules are...Other than looking for a wide peak! as i you have just indicated so i suppose i have learned something.  And i am guessing the width then is relevant to the Gev result?]]></description>

thanks Matt - what do you mean by strange? - you mean strange patterns =  patterns with a pattern?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your comment, I like your honesty and openness in this case. 

But why are you referring to a Z particle as a proof against a &quot;simple&quot; explanation like thunderstorms? They produce very low frequency radio waves, due to gamma rays (Fermi detected them). 

And rf waves have an effect on the confinement beam (http://prst-ab.aps.org/abstract/PRSTAB/v14/i9/e092802). CMS is build on wet clay, attracting lightning. 

Z particles are extremely short lived. You said &quot;.. well measured, such as the Z particle&quot;.

We likely won&#039;t see much of a &quot;well measured&quot; effect in reality, I suppose.]]></description>

I&#039;m afraid you&#039;re somewhat confused about the facts.

I described the numbers of events and showed the data as of July back in my series https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/ .  Since that time the number of events has roughly doubled.

You are confused about the fact that the &quot;loose cable&quot; that caused the mistaken neutrino measurements was from OPERA -- which is not located at CERN, but in Gran Sasso.  CMS is a completely different experiment, with a completely different organizational structure, much better suited for preventing such errors.  

Also, the measurements being done to discover the Higgs and measure its mass are not so susceptible to something as simple as a loose cable or thunderstorm, because such problems would also affect similar measurements of particles that are already known and well measured, such as the Z particle.  CMS and ATLAS data on the Z particle looks just fine.

Calibration methods done at ATLAS and CMS are looked at by dozens of people within those collaborations, and carefully reviewed before any results are released.

You say &quot;If someone is a scientist within an established community with a known general commitment one should be afraid to admit there is not a real proof for a Higgs here.
There is a clear surplus of energy, but an absolute proof of a Higgs boson needs more precise information.&quot;

This is partially incorrect.  There is not a &quot;clear surplus of energy&quot;; there is no surplus of energy at all.  There is a surplus of the number of collisions in which certain classes of processes occurs, all of them corresponding to roughly the same amount of invariant mass.  

It is correct, however, that the evidence, while very strong, is still not at the point of being so overwhelming that all uncertainties are gone.  And no one is afraid to say that.  There is clearly something new in the data; exactly what it is, time will tell.  We have a strong prejudice as to what it is; if that turns out to be wrong, that will be very exciting.  And there&#039;s not much to worry about, since the LHC has still only produced 5% or so of its total data set, and at less than its maximum energy.  We will learn a great deal more over coming years.

As for transparency in the data; I do wish there were more of it, with something this important.  I do think we will see a lot more in 2013, once the machine is shut down for repairs and upgrades, and the experimentalists are no longer working 29 hour days, 8 days a week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How many events are we talking here about, and within which time period?

I do not understand why there is no specific data - about exactly when these effects took place, and at which time &#038; date precisely and how many occurrences of energy excess have been measured.

If there is any local interference, like for example low energy photons from thunderstorms (producing radio waves with low frequencies) this would have an influence on the measurements. This would also explain the difference in derived Higgs&#039; mass in CMS and ATLAS.

But without data about actual detections there is no way to tell if there is a flaw like the superluminal neutrinos here.

Yes, this maybe farfetched - but a loose cable would have been also - some months ago, with a 6 sigma confidence from CMS.

If someone is a scientist within an established community with a known general commitment one should be afraid to admit there is not a real proof for a Higgs here.

There is a clear surplus of energy, but an absolute proof of a Higgs boson needs more precise information.

But there is no control over this information stream from any other independent party.  Since the debacle with those speedy neutrinos CERN is also really cautious in releasing too much information to the public.

They are trying hard (and quite successfully until now) to release only the information that is harmless to their cause.

With a 6 billion euros investment that is not really assuring, imho.

I would really like more openness in the delivered data.

In my personal opinion it was a good idea to inform the people about the problems with the superluminal neutrinos. It is a pity that Sergio Bertolucci, CERN&#039;s head of research who took this brave step is no longer in command.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/20/solution-to-yesterdays-puzzle-higgs-found/#comment-34606&quot;&gt;Markus Harder&lt;/a&gt;.

I think we all agree that 3 GeV (which is a 2.7 standard deviation) is probably too big for a purely statistical fluctuation.  That is, purely random chance is very unlikely to generate something that big.

However, systematic shifts are not random.  If there happens to be a technical problem that shifts the mass for a certain class of events down by 0.5 GeV/c2, then that&#039;s not a random fluctuation; it affects all of the events in that class in the same way.

So what we are probably dealing with is a combination of the two; a systematic shift from an experimental technicality (which is not random, and therefore doesn&#039;t cost anything in probability -- it is not a question of whether it is unlikely, it is either there or it is not) combined with a statistical fluke that happens, by random chance, to have gone in the same direction.  

Again, the combination of these two things is not likely, but it&#039;s probably not as unlikely as humans tend to think it is.

I cannot count the number of times that I have seen effects disappear or be explained away that naively were at 3 standard deviations from expectations.]]></description>
