You did fine, in a sense, in that you declared defeat if you couldn&#039;t find the mass.  But there was a Higgs signal in most of the plots.  The point, of course, is that one should not underestimate the challenges of working with very small numbers of events, as ATLAS and CMS are doing in their studies of the Higgs-like particle decaying to two lepton/anti-lepton pairs.]]></description>

In this case the error bars have a somewhat different meaning than by using simple, standard statistics on the data. Additional assumptions about the quality of each measurement enter the calculation; with the advantage of a better estimate of the mass, but at the cost of larger deviations if the assumptions made are not always valid.
If the result may depend significantly on a single event, an interesting test would be to do the same statistics again but excluding one (or two or three) events from the sample, and see how strongly the result differs. (Maybe they have done sort if this test in evaluating the measurements.)
However, even with a larger sample where individual measurements have less impact, a systematic error in the assumptions about the quality of the measurements may introduce a systematic bias.
Using &quot;more sophisticated&quot; methods that weigh the individual measurements may also make it more difficult to compare the results from different experiments and/or different detectors, at least if the weight calculation depends on the specific properties of the experiment/detector.
Certainly these issues are already being investigated now.]]></description>

One reason the error bars are smaller is what I mentioned; that the methods used are more sophisticated, with certain events that are much better measured than others being weighted more heavily.  But that also means that a single problematic event that is incorrectly believed to be well measured could push the result around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This example is quite illustrative. I would not attempt to identify the plots with a signal only by visual inspection; a serious statistical analysis, running the data through a computer program or at least a pocket calculator, seems necessary to me.
For example, the bottom-left plot seems to show a peak when inspected visually, but this peak is outside the expected mass range between 122 and 127, and also vanishes if smoothing out the plot by adding two adjacent bins into a single one.
Also, some plot may at first glance indicate that there is not a single peak but two or three of them; but when running a detailed analysis it may turn out that there is no statistically significant peak at all in them.
Even when doing detailed statistics, there are different ways to look a the data. One may test the hypothesis that there is no signal, and all the spikes are just noise; one may test the hypothesis that there is one single peak with a specified width (but this is cheating, using external information); and there are further hypotheses to test, such as for 2 or 3 peaks, or one large peak and a small one ... (Here I refer to the simulated plots, not to the idea of 2 Higgs in the real LHC data.)
Certainly we need the patience to wait for a larger amount of data generated by the LHC before being able to tell details.
A bit surprising to me is that for the real LHC data, the error bars given for the Higgs mass estimates are so small; possibly there are additional, not yet detected sources of inaccurate measurements that need to be taken into account.]]></description>
