					<description><![CDATA[You actually make it seem so easy with your presentation but I find this matter to be actually something that I think I would never understand.

It seems too complicated and very broad for me.
I am looking forward for your next post, I&#039;ll try 
to get the hang of it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/10/new-attempt-at-atomic-article/#comment-32574&quot;&gt;Kudzu&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you Mr Kudzu, teaching correct science is a service to society. 

Tribal societies(where religions survive) need Enlightenment- eventhough it was told contrary in bible as Adam&#039;s apple(forbidden fruit).
We did enjoyed the fruits of Enlightenment of last centuries. 

If the wave nature(frequency) and its energy(quanta) is exactly replicated then we have teleportation - is an old science fiction. 

&quot;Nothing to being&quot;, a quantum state of &quot;zero&quot; rhythm, in phase with various frequencies is a &quot;cosmic dance&quot; in micro level(quanta of light proportional to frequency of the electromagnetic wave). 
Where these frequencies intensify, where its phase transition become almost nothing is the question( we interpret that as  neutrino oscillation and gauge invariance ).

We may never going to understand that otherwise for good or bad, some unexpected discoveries may happen like anti gravity vehicles??

I have to learn more equations Mr Kudzu.]]></description>

Just as a side note, a mirror, being a 2D surface reverses two directions in your reflection; left-right and front-back (Something that is further behind you appears further in front of you when seen in the mirror.)]]></description>

Patrice -- thanks for your reply.

No, I wasn&#039;t saying that Quantum Field Theory (QFT) says anything about internal structure of electrons; quite the contrary.  Electrons are pointlike in the current Standard Model.   But what QFT does do, compared to quantum mechanics, is change the relationship between electrons, the wave function describing the state of one or more electrons, and the wave-like properties of those electrons.  

By chance, I had a conversation yesterday at the Institute for Advanced Study with several famous theorists about the question of what QFT says about quantum entanglement.  No one was aware of any fully relativistic quantum-field-theory treatment of the quantum entanglement arising in, say, the Bell inequality.  I assume the same is true for Wineland and Haroche.  And this is a serious issue if one wants to draw correct conclusions about locality and causality; it seems unlikely that quantum mechanics alone would allow these subtleties to be properly addressed.  So it would appear that there is more research to be done, though it is possible that it has been done and that the people I spoke to are simply unaware of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear GEN: As Richard Feynman pointed out, the way key insights in science have been brought forward varies so much that there is no such as thing as &quot;understanding how discovering new science operates&quot;... Besides of course, the fact that science, in full, means that experiments, repeated ad nauseam, give always the results that the theory expects. Basically the scientific method is common sense supported by unimpeachable experimental evidence. Operating this method, in turn, leads to a body of knowledge, science itself. New minds have to learn both the method, and the fruits of its application. Indeed.
Kind regards to you too.]]></description>

new theories try to offer better predictions to a wider set of experiments, with the least amount of parameters and assumptions.

Theories can&#039;t attempt to settle down issues for many reasons, but one of these reasons is the fact that we do not know have perfect instruments to capture all the details behind a certain physical fenomenum, so, we have no way to verify if certain important aspects are left out of our model to be able to resolve a certain scientific issue once and for all.

We do have an iterative and incremental approach to a certain aspect of nature, so, over time, we have a broader and deeper understanding of a larger subset of important dimensions and variable that are significant to a certain domain of nature, but that is as far as we can expect to get.

To understand how science operates, there are certain ideas and concepts pertaining to the scientific method that must be understood and accepted.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/10/new-attempt-at-atomic-article/#comment-32332&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for your kind answer Professor,
This Nope occurred from my question in 7th standard(by fuzzy and obscure natural language). I repeatedly asked my science teacher, &quot;why my image in the mirror is not me?&quot;. He was annoyed and said, &quot;it reflect your right into left and left into right, so it is not you&quot;. 
I was unsatisfied, if &quot;reflect&quot; not me, if it return it is me?. 

Why mc^2 ?

&quot;c&quot; is the speed of the light, not speed of the photons. At speed c we didnt know at what form(phase transition) photon exists, thanks it is massless. 
You have said, two photons travel in opposite directions in a closed system, the system acquire photon mass. 
In this situation, we cannot say the photon(s) travel in opposite directions, roaring around or &quot;returning around&quot; in the closed system like atmosphere ? 
At the point of &quot;return&quot; the momentum will be zero and the speed will be doubled(c^2) ?- though light cannot exceed c it must cancel each other(into nothing- Higgs h)- but before it cancel, it acquire a non zero value as c^2. So photon blackholes disappears?

Higgs(h) is also nothing and transcendental, wherever its non zero value &quot;vev&quot; occurs, it reacts with every charges and frequencies and increase the intensities of frequencies(quanta or bundles of energies). We interpret as various particles as electron, positron, antielectron, antipositron ect.. 
If the density of the intensities is more, we interpret as particle with mass(xc^2)?.  Remember, there was tiny masses of various types locked in closed system during Big bang.
But the Higgs(h) have a peculiar behaviour of exceeding the system and interact outside for a while ? 

I apologise, as I take it for granted quantum state&#039;s non intuitive skips, non classical analogies and anomalies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Matt: Thank you for your kind answer. Sorry I took so long to react. I am also sorry that my sibylline conclusion led you to feel that I believed there has been no progress since Dirac. I was thinking of the duality wave-particle. There was, of course, gigantic progress in Quantum Field Theory. I am a fervent admirer of many of the great ideas of QFT.

However, QFT is focused towards high energies. As you yourself seem to point out, something is still amiss:
&quot;[What&#039;s] somewhat confusing even for experts) is that electrons are, on the one hand, best described in many circumstances as point-like particles (much smaller than atoms, and smaller even than atomic nuclei) yet around atoms they are in some way spread out in a very non-particle-like fashion. Well, indeed, thinking of elementary objects like electrons as “particles” will get you into trouble; for one thing, they are really “quanta” of quantum fields, and in most circumstances they behave much more like waves… And yet it is essential…to reveal whether they, like baseballs, rocks and dumplings, have internal structure.
Ok, I can’t even figure out how to write this paragraph clearly. There needs to be a way to explain this issue, one that is both moderately intuitive and based on accurate and clear physical reasoning…&quot;

Are you suggesting that this &quot;internal structure&quot; is provided by Quantum Field Theory? Is that &quot;fresh coat of paint&quot; enough to settle once and for all the relationship between the wavy aspect and the particle aspect of field quanta? Or, for that matter, any piece of matter whatsoever? Does QFT helps in understanding, say, Quantum Entanglement, and did it help in the new methods elaborated by Wineland and Haroche?]]></description>
