					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/#comment-32803&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

Matt: I have two questions regarding black holes.
Q1) why black hole&#039;s entropy corresponds to its surface area at Schwarzschild radius? (=i.e. larger the surface area, larger the entropy.)
I read that a black hole cannot split into two because the split reduces its entropy(=surface area). However, it can still evaporate and reduce its entropy because the evaporation(radiation) process dumps the entropy into space. Is this true? How/why? the Hawking radiation has much higher entropy than its not yet evaporated black hole? How can you calculate the total entropy of a (small) black hole and the total entropy after it is completely evaporated? can you use Boltzmann formula to compute them?

Q2)I read that a spinning black hole looks asymmetric due to relativistic effect. Does this mean that an electron also looks asymmetric due to its (intrinsic) spin? Is relativistic effect applicable to any system/object/particle?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the information loss problem is thrown into starker relief if you think almost in more classical terms of high frequency radiation entering a system - higher frequency = more information storage capacity in a smaller space - after being filtered through chemical/biological systems etc a small number of high energy photons are converted to a larger number of low frequency photons so the information is &quot;smeared out&quot; kind of like a holographic plate being expanded (or red-shifted) - the info is still there it;s just a matter of whether you can get it since any information processing procedure requires entropic gradients to make it work - that&#039;s my take anyway.]]></description>

Here are some arguments saying that the mixed state density matrix can be corrected by an invisibly small amount (due to QG effects) such that the observe Hawking radiation is pure again for a pure initial state:
