					<description><![CDATA[Well, the reason to add a leap second every now and then (this does not happen according to a precise and repetitive schedule, as it is based on detailed observations of the rate of spin of the Earth) is in fact that the Earth is slowing down its rate of spin over time, due to the work exerted by non conservative forces (friction forces) and other various effects that affect the rate of spin.

Just to name a few: the friction caused by all bodies of water (seas, rivers, lakes, etc.). The friction caused by the air, the friction caused by all moving bodies in touch with the surface of the Earth (like ourselves!).

Besides, the Moon is slowing spinning away from the Earth, and that also affects the rate of spin of the Earth.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

A little addendum to your little arbitrariness; the addition of leap seconds is primarily not due to the Earth&#039;s rotation slowing down (It is, but at a rate a thousand times to small to account for leap seconds, see here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second#Slowing_down_of_the_Earth where the rate is given as less than 2 milliseconds per century.)

Instead the reason is that UTC was established a long time ago and two or so centuries of the earth slowing have made each modern day about  86,400.002 second long according to atomic clocks. Multiply that by 365 days per year and that&#039;s nearly 3/4 of a second that the two rates differ.

A good explanation of the concepts involved can be found here: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/06/30/wait-just-a-second-no-really-wait-just-a-second/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One more little arbitrariness: the length of the second. For a very long time (pun intended) we thought that the celestial orbs were the perfect clocks, and used them as our standards for time keeping (in many varied ways, as you state, but still based on what we thought was going on in &quot;the perfect heavens&quot;).  Toward the end of the 1800s, astronomers used their accumulated careful measurements to come up with the best measurements of the length of a day, and hence of the second (the so-called &quot;Ephemeris Second&quot;).  Trouble is, neither the Earth&#039;s orbit nor the Earth&#039;s spin is all that regular.  By the mid-1950s, using data from the 1800s gave incorrect positions and timing of astronomical events.  And when atomic clocks started counting the &quot;ticks&quot; of things that really do occur in repeatably equal times, we discovered that the length of an astronomically-based &quot;second&quot; would have to change continuously!  From the 1950s to the early 1970s, the time of day was already off from celestial time by over 32 seconds.  Throw in a few relativistic effects, based on height above (or below) the geoid and relative speed differences, and things get really weird.  Namely, almost all of our standards of measurement involve time, and hence the definition of the second.  So, to maintain some degree of rationality, we now define the SI second in terms of the rate of transitions of atoms of Cesium under very specific conditions.  But its duration was chosen to maintain compatibility with that previous (arbitrary and incorrect) &quot;Ephemeris Second&quot;.  

We now have standards bodies all around the earth with atomic clocks, and we have the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Measures)  that correlates all those measurements, taking into account things like their elevation and latitude, to come up with a standard &quot;atomic time&quot; (&quot;TAI&quot;) based on the SI second.  The International Earth Rotation Service also measures, models, and predicts Earth&#039;s actual rotation and orbital motion, and issues corrections to &quot;clock time&quot; (&quot;UTC&quot;) to keep clocks in relatively close sync (within a second) of actual solar time - the time of high noon as the Sun crosses the Greenwich Meridian.  (Actual astronomical observations use other relativistic time standards, but all are based on the SI atomic time standard.)  Thus we get &quot;Leap Seconds&quot; every few years: at the end of June or December, we sometimes get minutes that are either 59 seconds (a negative leap second, never needed so far) or 61 seconds long.  The last Leap Second, the 26th since 1972, was added on 30 June 2012: on that day, 23:59:60.0pm was a valid time!  If we didn&#039;t do that, &quot;noon&quot; would eventually start happening when the sun comes up rather than when it is directly overhead in Greenwich (or more accurately, a few miles from Greenwich, where the actual Meridian really is).  But again, these leap seconds don&#039;t happen on any regular schedule.  The rate at which the Earth&#039;s rotation is slowing down varies quite a bit (sometimes even speeding back up), affected by everything from earthquakes and the motion of its rotational axis and the poles to tides to weather.  And like the weather, we can&#039;t accurately predict when we will need another leap second (or not) for more than a few months in advance.  So you really can&#039;t know exactly when the next 12:12:12 will occur even a few years from now - there may have been multiple leap seconds added in in the mean time!  How&#039;s that for the Universe itself (not just us humans) being arbitrary? :)]]></description>
