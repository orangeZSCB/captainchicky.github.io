					<description><![CDATA[Does the Higgs field resistance per particle vary near E=mc2?  Does time dialation become integrated dimensionally as harmonic fluctuation push/drag across ST lattice?  Polyhedral lensing on Planck scalars interfere w/ST if higgs field constant varies per chromatic wavelength.  Maby superstring or spin foam, standard modle harmonics seem less static everyday.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice blog.  Will be interesting to see what the Swedes do with this one month from today.  It would be great to see the committee have the guys to award it to all of the remaining theorists.  My bet is they do not but let&#039;s hope.  Prioritizing some over others given the merits of all the papers does not seem right.]]></description>

If you&#039;re suggesting my remarks are 20-20 hindsight, go read my articles after the Higgs discovery and you&#039;ll see the points are essentially the same.  https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/  It never occurred to me that the Higgs crew would get a Nobel so fast, so I didn&#039;t even bother to comment on it.]]></description>
