					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/09/quantum-physics-is-very-real/#comment-21235&quot;&gt;Ã‰der Rocha Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt;.

This question makes a few incorrect assumptions.

Firstly Schrodinger&#039;s cat paradox doesn&#039;t explain anything, it&#039;s a &#039;thought experiment&#039; initially created to highlight the problems in current thinking. Namely, if particles really don&#039;t collapse into something unless observed, then the &#039;real world&#039; should behave rather oddly. Why doesn&#039;t it? (trying this experiment with a real cat has very different results from those predicted.)

This is the problem of superposition and decoherence, and one of the things people forget is that an &#039;observer&#039; doesn&#039;t need to be a human, (the cat is observing itself is it not?) or even alive. A particle can be &#039;observed&#039; just by something else bumping into it.

The second problem is assuming science is trying to explain &#039;eternal life&#039;; the mainstream scientific opinion is that there is no solid, reproducible evidence for eternal life; we cannot scatter protons off of heaven, and we&#039;re quite sure that when someone dies they&#039;re well... dead. Some scientists are looking at testing things like out of body experiences (With bright, simple pictures on the ceilings of operating theaters for example.) but most of our &#039;evidence&#039; so far is just stories people have told. Even as a believer in the spiritual I don&#039;t expect much proof to be forthcoming.

Science would do better aiming for reincarnation, since we know that earth is made of stardust and that our atoms will, when we pass away quite quickly become part of another living thing. It&#039;s almost poetic.]]></description>

I believe that quantum entanglement, of the highest order, may have something to do about consciousness. Like Prof Strassler barely hinted, &quot;itâ€™s probably playing a big role in biology that weâ€™re just starting to understand:&quot; the dynamics at that small scale are so precise why wouldn&#039;t play a major role in the macroscopic, classical world?

And what about a universal consciousness that permeates all of spacetime, now that would be &quot;Divine&quot;. :-)]]></description>
