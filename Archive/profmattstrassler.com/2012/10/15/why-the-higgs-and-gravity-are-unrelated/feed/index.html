					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Gravitational fields have spin 2 and are described as part of space and time; they interact with all particles and fields in nature. The Higgs field, which has spin 0, only interacts directly with elementary particles and fields that also participate in the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces.&quot;

Preample: If there is unification, one fundamental &quot;force&quot;, then there must be a link between gravity and the Higgs (and all the other mass giving fields).

So, what concept can be created to put both (all) in the same equation? ... Can the Fourier transform be used to explain this relationship? 

Here is one idea; Looking at the overall picture of the universe, the &quot;cosmic web&quot; you see the structure as an array of filaments of various lengths and shapes and energies but a web all connected together (by gravity?). And this system of galaxies and everything else moving and interact like any other system we have analyzed with the use of the Fourier transform. And like any system there is a fundamental frequency and many (almost infinite) harmonics (at lower energies). 

So, can the gravitational field be the fundamental and the Higgs (and others) are the &quot;lower&quot; harmonics of the same &quot;universal field&quot;. And it is these lower harmonics, Higgs, which are giving mass (low velocities energies packets)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mass is an illusion just as the appearance of solidity. The Higgs field imparts a &quot;drag&quot; on the particle  giving the appearance of what we know as mass.

					<description><![CDATA[Undeniably consider that which you said. Your favorite justification appeared to be on the internet the simplest factor to have in mind of.
I say to you, I definitely get irked while folks consider issues that they just 
don&#039;t understand about. You controlled to hit the nail upon the highest as well as defined out the entire thing without 
having side-effects , other people could take a signal.
Will probably be again to get more. Thanks]]></description>
