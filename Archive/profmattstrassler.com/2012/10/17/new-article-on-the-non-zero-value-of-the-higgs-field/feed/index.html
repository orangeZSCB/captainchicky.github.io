					<description><![CDATA[Simultaneously? ...

    Now, for the first time, a new type of experiment has shown light behaving like both a particle and a wave simultaneously, ...

I guess it all depends on how one defines simultaneously. The energy-time uncertainty principle states,

dE x dT ~ h-bar

... where the time T is the time in which the state of any observed variable, with an energy dE potential, remains unchanged. This definition of time is very different than the time in Schrodinger&#039;s equation, which formulates the motion of all particle/waves.

What this means is that instantaneity does not exist, which is required for any one particle (wave) to be in two states at the same time, simultaneously. There is a finite time interval for a single state to change from one quantum number to another. So what the experiment is showing is a photon oscillating back and forth from particle to wave, but the time is so small we cannot sense it. The time is so small we don&#039;t even have the physics to understand what is happening in that tiny, tiny point in spacetime.

What I would like to know is how does the quantum number(s) vary with temperature? The conjecture being that at absolute &quot;zero&quot; temperature the photon should be exhibiting only wave-like characteristics which it transforms into a particle as the temperature increases. In other words, the state of a point in space (the quanta of spacetime if you will) can be characterized by the energy it contains, energy density.

Energy density ... --&#062; B(x,y,z,t) ~ variation of energy density in Schrodinger&#039;s time.]]></description>
