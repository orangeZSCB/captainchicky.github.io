					<description><![CDATA[If Higgs field would give mass to all fundamental particles wouldn&#039;t it be logical not to consider mass a funadamental property of elementary particles - after all mass was observed first in macroscopic objects and the concept was generalized to elementary particles later. In that case interaction of any elementary particle with Higgs field would be the fundamental proporety of that particle and mass would be the deduced property.
However if the Higgs boson have its own mass doesn&#039;t this make it an exception? The fundamental physics is all about unifications, right. Exceptions should not be wellcome or even allowed?]]></description>

Again why would I want to waste my time with theory when what I already share is  the factual evidence proving that the higgs boson proving origin is false. I am not some physicist desperate to get his name into history books with any delusions I can possibly fathom, I am a Primary Factual Fundamentalist and World Class Activist whom takes great pleasure in fighting for the well being of current and future generations.

 You want o contest what I share as fact, instead of wasting your time with theories, simply share one factual example of anything going poof into existence out of nothingness or one factual example of anything going poof from existence into nothingness.

 You never will because what I am sharing is fact.

Why waste my time with theory when I am obviously past theory by sharing fact.

Again, You want proof that everything always is was and always will be enduring through infinite change, For a demonstration of factual evidence of origin just watch this 23 minute video and lets see even one physicist across the planet contest what I share with so much as a shred of validity, let alone everyone else on the planet! Not one physicist is capable let alone anyone else on the planet and that’s a fact!

To watch the video simply:
Go to You Tube.
In the search box on You Tube type my name, David Jeffrey Spetch..
When the list of videos comes up, avoid clicking on a video but instead click on my member name David Jeffrey Spetch.
This will bring you to my channel page.
The feature video on my channel page is what you are looking for.

also I will share this:  Not one person on the globe is able to contest the facts I share with so much as a shred of validity.

 They even claim that particles appear then disappear. Take photons for example.

 It took energy matter and time to re create energy and matter for the sun to send a photon.

 That photon comes to  Earth for example but doesn&#039;t just disappear, it helps warm the planet, aids life with such as photosynthesis because the facts remains that it takes energy matter and time to re create energy and matter.

 Not anything goes poof into existence out of nothingness and not anything that exists goes poof into nothingness.

I fear that you make the same mistake as the people that you criticize make.
Why not provide a theory that shows how particles obtain mass? That would make the Higgs obsolete!
For me having mass means having the capability to curve space in the embedding environment.
Thus, show how massive elementary particles curve their embedding continuum.

A suggestion is given in &quot;A mathematical model of reality&quot;;

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been sharing this with inter parliamentary unions and government officials of the globe recently.including Norway, Nordic council and Nobel Committee (since they so freely handed an award to a liar just because he is a physicist)

Physicists Claims of Higgs Boson is Proof of Origin Is False

 ... because where did the energy to generate near the speed of light come from in the first place as the well particles that collided? I&#039;ll answer that which proves the Higgs Boson proving origin is still nothing more than a falsified theory right now! 

What is missing here is, how does smashing particles together near light speed equal proof that a Higgs boson exists? These physicists appear to be so stuck on the big bang &quot;theory&quot; in how they think space was created that they are so very desperate to call proof of the Higgs Boson exists because they smashed particles at light speed together. To top it off with attempting to reduce their false attempt of discovery to use as propaganda to further promote religious anything further reveals the greedy and selfish motivations behind this inferior exposed plot.

What I suspect is what happened with the physicists involved recently with this is that Higgs made an observation upon seeing things bang at high speed. He made a theory by using what he observed to further confirm the big bang theory but didn&#039;t succeed with factual evidence. Now these Physicists are observing the same thing that Higgs observed which now, they are attempting to claim that them seeing the same thing that Higgs observed to inspire Higgs to come up with a theory proves that the theory is anything more than still a theory. It&#039;s only a theory that still has not been validated with any kind of validity or factual evidence.. People are so very desperate to get their name into history books.

 Fact remains that for any bang to first occur, no matter how large or small the bang is, it first takes energy matter and time to re create energy and matter for any bang no matter how large or small to first occur. Energy matter and time always was, is and always will be because the fact remains that not anything goes poof into existence out of nothingness. Not anything that exists goes poof into nothingness.

 Many religious are those who worship or pray to the factually proven lie referred to by the religious as god, which is acknowledgement from themselves that what they worship or pray to must have intelligence to be able to understand. They also claim that what they pray to or worship is the creator of everything.

 Not anything is able to go poof into existence out of nothingness, let alone be able to develop an intelligence without there first be energy matter and time to re create energy and matter.

 Share with me even one example of anything going poof into existence out of nothingness?! No one ever will because the fact remains that it takes energy matter and time to recreate energy and matter.

  For any particle to have the opportunity to collide with an opposing particle near the speed of light it first took energy matter and time to re create energy and matter.

 Here are these physicists, whom themselves consist of energy and matter and these physicists are aging which is evidence of time. They are constructing equipment through a processes of energy matter and time to re create energy and matter. They are using what they construct to conduct experiments of which the results of their experiments is more proof that it takes energy matter and time to re create energy and matter. 

 You want proof that everything always is was and always will be enduring through infinite change, For a demonstration of factual evidence of origin just watch this 23 minute video and lets see even one physicist across the planet contest what I share with so much as a shred of validity, let alone everyone else on the planet! Not one physicist  is capable let alone anyone else on the planet and that&#039;s a fact!

Sir, Space is not alone.When it combines with time it will form a fluid like medium. Every mass will be balanced and associated with certain space-time fluid. It is related by &#039;Siva&#039;s classical Equations for space-time&#039;m =7×10^12 (d^1/3).and  γ d^(8/3) = 1.69×10^12 . The density of the space time fluid give rise to curvature just similar to fluid mechanics. Also the same space time fluid is cause for the creation of mass and explained as the basic building block of mass named as&#039;K-Suryon&#039;.
