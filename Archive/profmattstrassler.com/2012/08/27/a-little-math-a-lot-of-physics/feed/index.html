Prof. Strassler, is the contingency as mentioned inconsistent with the supposed preservation of information (Black Hole paradox) or not?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I qualify as having an &#039;advanced pre-university&#039; physics background, and I decided a year or so ago that I wanted to gain a greater understanding of modern particle physics. I&#039;m not particularly driven to understand the Higgs field, per se, but I&#039;ve found your site very helpful - articles such as that on virtual particles and the one that explains the quark make up of the proton have cleared up nagging questions that I had - so thank-you. 

In short, the conclusion that I&#039;ve come to is that I really need to get to grips  as much as possible with the maths behind at least some of the more basic physics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am quite interested in the descriptions you have given and of others who may have shared perspective from a historical sense.

Quotes in Brackets -  &quot;Let us see how these great physicists used harmonic oscillators to establish beachheads to new physics.

    Albert Einstein used harmonic oscillators to understand specific heats of solids and found that energy levels are quantized. This formed one of the key bridges between classical and quantum mechanics.

    Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger formulated quantum mechanics. The role of harmonic oscillators in this process is well known.

    Paul A. M. Dirac was quite fond of harmonic oscillators. He used oscillator states to construct Fock space. He was the first one to consider harmonic oscillator wave functions normalizable in the time variable. In 1963, Dirac used coupled harmonic oscillators to construct a representation of the O(3,2) de Sitter group which is the basic scientific language for two-mode squeezed states.

    Hediki Yukawa was the first one to consider a Lorentz-invariant differential equation, with momentum-dependent solutions which are Lorentz-covariant but not Lorentz-invariant. He proposed harmonic oscillators for relativistic extended particles five years before Hofstadter observed that protons are not point particles in 1955. Some people say he invented a string-model approach to particle physics.

    Richard Feynman was also fond of harmonic oscillators. When he gave a talk at the 1970 Washington meeting of the American Physical Society, he stunned the audience by telling us not to use Feynman diagrams, but harmonic oscillators for quantum bound states. This figure illustrates what he said in 1970.


    We are still allowed to use Feynman diagrams for running waves. Feynman diagrams applicable to running waves in Einstein&#039;s Lorentz-covariant world. Are Feynman&#039;s oscillators Lorentz-covariant? Yes in spirit, but there are many technical problems. Then can those problems be fixed. This is the question. You may be interested in reading about this subject: Lorentz group in Feynman&#039;s world.

    Can harmonic oscillators serve as a bridge between quantum mechanics and special relativity?&quot; 


and.......

The Landscape “avant la lettre” by A.N. Schellekens- http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0604134

    &quot;The lowest harmonics correspond to the particles of the Standard Model, plus perhaps a few new particles. The higher harmonics correspond to an infinite series of particles that we can never observe, unless we can build a Planck Energy accelerator&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[BUT what you said leads to  a basic Q :
What mechanism controls the electron field for ex. to ensure that  billions upon billions of electrons on the cosmic scale have same mass and charge ?
If mass and charge are contingent not necessary then something must control ALL field oscillations /ripples to have exactly same values .
Then we are still waiting for your answer to : what are charges ,electric or color ?
are we in the land of the unknowable ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What you just said is really great , allow me to add that any physical  mechanism to generate all those properties is totally dependent on those same laws and constants and properties it assumed to generate   , if we say that  the mechanism could depend on extra cosmic laws and constants then we are in an impossible infinite regression.....
Yes my friend our cosmos IS contingent , no other way.]]></description>
