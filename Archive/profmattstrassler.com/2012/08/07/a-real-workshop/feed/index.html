					<description><![CDATA[This design is steller! You most certainly know how to keep a 
reader amused. Between your wit and your videos, I was 
almost moved to start my own blog (well, almost...
HaHa!) Great job. I really loved what you had to say, and 
more than that, how you presented it. Too cool!]]></description>

If possible, I would like to know in a little more detail how it must be &quot;natural&quot; for spin-zero hadrons to have additional partner particles, and  likewise for particles in the physics of solids.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Strassler: I can confirm what Richard Benish wrote about problems rendering the &quot;Higgs FAQ 1.0&quot; for print compared to this article. It appears to be a left margin issue; the text is cut off on the left. (I was using Chrome on Windows7.) This article renders fine.  Might be a CSS problem; the WordPress folks might be able to help (when you have a moment).]]></description>

I&#039;ve tested the issue from two different computers, a Mac and a Windows 7 machine. Same behavior. I&#039;d guess you could confirm it by trying to print or convert to pdf yourself. Your &quot;Higgs FAQ 1.0&quot; is an example of a misbehaving article (as are most that I&#039;ve tried). The left half of the page gets cut off. Perhaps someone at Wordpress can help.

Thanks again for all your good work.]]></description>

&quot;Past experiments&quot; refers to (a) hadrons [the spin-zero particles of QCD satisfy this criterion, with lots of partner particles], and (b) various examples of such particles in the physics of solids.

So no, this has never arisen in past experiments among the particles we now think of as fundamental (though of course we didn&#039;t know the hadrons weren&#039;t fundamental particles until the mid 50s.)  None of the cases you mention are related to the issue I was referring to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/07/a-real-workshop/#comment-16109&quot;&gt;Younghun Park&lt;/a&gt;.

In principle it is possible, as far as the data is concerned. And if in fact its spin is not zero, then no, it cannot be explained by the Standard Model.

However, I would not get your hopes up.  This particle behaves, so far, roughly like the spin-zero Higgs expected in the Standard Model and some of its variants.  It would be quite a surprise for a spin-two particle to behave this way; it would be purely accidental for it to resemble our expectation for the Higgs (in terms of how often it is produced and how it decays.)]]></description>

I don&#039;t know why there would be any difference between past articles and present ones.  I am using Wordpress software that I only partly control, and I have not changed anything in the way that I construct pages, so I have no idea why this one would be different.]]></description>
