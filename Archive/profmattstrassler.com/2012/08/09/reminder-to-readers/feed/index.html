					<description><![CDATA[I can fully agree with prof. Strasser/ P. Woit&#039;s stance regarding the Milner&#039;s prize. What the contemporary physics is seriously lacking is the support of practical findings and approaches, which lead into testable predictions. It&#039;s OK to appreciate the fundamental findings and bright ideas, but the bright ideas which are proven correct first should be considered brightest. I&#039;m affraid, the Milner&#039;s  prize goes in the exactly the opposite direction. The sad example of cold fusion will become a big memento of mainstream physics of last twenty years. BTW only 1,5 million dollars is needed for buying of one E-cat unit and making sure, it really works as claimed at rigorous scientific basis.]]></description>

Yeah, after writing that, I thought of Lisa Randall.

I wonder if the accolades given in theoretical physics are a bit uneven generally. Perhaps because the layperson is very unlikely to really understand which theorists are worthy of awards. (to the extent that people giving these awards are laypeople)]]></description>

&quot;If your notion of “real science” is that a theorist is like the mythical Einstein day in and day out, then you have a very limited view of both theorists and Einstein. Not all of Einstein’s work was inventing new theories either.&quot;

Well said, that man. The role of the hard working professional  who draws a salary as a professor of physics doing the experimental instrumentation analysis is indeed vital to today&#039;s popular notion of science, and should not be dismissed by popularist ideas that science is about trying to be revolutionary. As Feyerabend said (in Against Method, 1975), science is not a particular any method of working, or a search for ultimate truth or simplicity, but the most useful method available at the time, even if it appears to the layman to be more like a professional technician dealing with analysis of instrumentation, than a revolutionary or maverick like one popular image of Einstein.]]></description>

Indeed, the fields that Milner chose to honor continue to have a terrible time convincing the smartest women in the world to chose them for a career; the numbers are very small.  A lot of other fields are doing much, much better.  So that does limit the numbers of candidates in high-energy physics theory.  (High-energy experiment is a completely different matter; consider that XENON100 dark matter experiment is run by Elena Aprile [Columbia], that ATLAS has been headed for quite some time by Fabiola Gianotti [CERN], that miniBooNE had Janet Conrad [MIT] as co-spokesperson, that microBooNE has Bonnie Fleming [Yale] as spokesperson, etc. etc.  We may well see one of these people win a Nobel someday.)

I&#039;m not suggesting something consciously nefarious, just deeply unfortunate and hard to believe; you can certainly choose your criteria carefully (and unconsciously) so that none of the women in those fields rise to the top of your list.  Among currently very active senior scientists in theoretical high-energy physics, Lisa Randall [Harvard], Ann Nelson [Washington] and Eva Silverstein [Stanford] are three of the smartest physicists I&#039;ve met; you can choose criteria where at least one would be on the list, and criteria where none of them would be.  (Silverstein got a MacArthur fellowship ten or so years ago; neither Nelson nor Randall nor Arkani-Hamed has gotten one, as far as I recall, which I find a little astonishing.  The only non-string or non-mostly-string theorist to get one in recent years is Frank Wilczek, who was already on the list to get a Nobel; there&#039;s clearly a double-standard there.) The same goes for a number of men in my field whom you&#039;ve probably never heard of but whom I think might have been seriously considered had Milner slightly adjusted his criteria. Suffice it to say that there are different types of theoretical contributions that are of value to science, not just the ones that Milner chose to honor.  

I don&#039;t know enough of the people in cosmology or quantum computing or the brand of math done by Konsevich to say anything about those fields.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One nit not already picked: I don&#039;t really mind that no &#039;heroines&#039; were included in the first round. It&#039;s too small of a sample size to claim that there is something nefarious going on. Also, can you name a working female physicist that meets all of the other requirements, of the caliber of Nima, et. al? 

(note: I don&#039;t know if one exists...I&#039;m just curious. As a layperson with 1 degree of separation from the physics community, no names come to mind.)]]></description>

I don&#039;t think you understood the context.  Of course any real work is made up from many small sub-projects embedded within larger ones, and some of those sub-projects take hours, others days, others months.  But I was in conversation with someone who makes lots of statements about the Large Hadron Collider but has never done any real work contributing to it, while I worked overtime for the last six months on making sure the data gathering is optimized  https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/triggering-advances-in-2012/data-parking-at-cms/, and I&#039;m working now to make sure the results of the workshop  https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/07/a-real-workshop/  are properly summarized and delivered.  So when I say someone&#039;s statement about LHC data is incorrect, I do know what I&#039;m talking about, and I don&#039;t have a lot of time to argue with people who wouldn&#039;t contribute anything positive to the LHC no matter whether or not I convinced them.]]></description>

Experimental results do not come out of thin air.  Theorists calculated that an experiment like the LHC would be needed in order to find the Higgs particle; that&#039;s why the LHC was built with the energy and collision rate that it has.  Theorists calculated that the rates for Higgs production and decay would be of a sort that two-photon and four-lepton final states would be the most important; that&#039;s why both ATLAS and CMS were designed to be so good at measuring the energies of photons and leptons.  Theorists pointed out that a cosmological constant could be detected by measuring supernova light curves; that&#039;s why observers went out and measured them.  Theorists pointed out that neutrinos could be studied using big water tanks.

Theorists don&#039;t just invent theories.  They do calculations within existing or speculative theories, and propose relevant experiments, and new interpretations of old experiments, based on those calculations.  Indeed, the most important work that I have done in my career is in this class.  And that&#039;s why theorists and experimentalists meet regularly, as they did at the workshop I described last week.
