					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your addressing the area of &quot;ethics&quot; in your blog. I disagree with Ben Lillie above that the increased number of incidents has more to do with better detection than an actual increase. Instead, it has more to do with a lack of leadership, as journalism no longer provides accountability (checks and balances) and negative &quot;written&quot; consequences for those who are unethical. A lack of consequence is important as the journalism industry influences all of us, including scientists. Enough journalists don&#039;t bring these cases to light in a systematic way, I propose. Instead, they follow the money trail to appeal to a broad readers&#039; base and try to help us all feel better about ourselves, our world - and in so doing they &quot;make this stuff up.&quot; The feelings won&#039;t last for long. This broad readers&#039; base struggle to know what is ethically wrong and need leadership from each field to lead them in understanding reality in that field, not something that simply makes us feel better about ourselves (or our role in giving other nations a piece of the scientific discovery pie) and achievements.  

An example of lack-of-leadership, in my opining, is the response of IAU when it appeared that a Spanish scientist had been tracking the logs of coordinates for camera pointing (the IP address was traced to his university and student help) as Mike Brown was tracking an asteroid eventually named &quot;Haumea&quot;. Ortiz claimed discovery though it appears it was only because he saw Brown tracking the asteroid as Brown was gathering necessary ephemeris data. Although the IAU allowed Brown to name Haumea (the right of the discoverer)  the IAU doesn&#039;t acknowledge Brown as the discoverer with Brown&#039;s name under that heading. When Brown followed up with Ortiz, Ortiz accused Brown of hiding data; Brown replied that scientists need time to accurately provide data. Where is the IAU&#039;s support for the scientist and the need for time to do science adequately? Where is the scientific leadership in a time of falling ethical standards?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[to deceptively  claim what is not your own,is a battle i have had more recent experience with than i would have though logical...having no academic experience,,but a passion for science,i had been attempting to develop some principles for time,and posting comments or blogs to receive feedback,and interact with a science community better suited to help with my development...during the process i had received some accusation of copying and pasting some of my comments,,,which i thought was quite funny considering my comments would be the last for anyone to reproduce,,as i was battling to even get them heard,,,;luckily for me,on the subject of time,,there were not too many works attempting to develop it as science,,,and the person in question,had little understanding of the words they were claiming as their own,,from there simple questions about my subject matter quickly exposed the truth,,,at the end of it though i couldnt help but feel somewhat sorry for them,,if only they had taken the time to understand what i was stating,they might have got away with it,,even then however all they would have received for it some complimentary remarks from young readers,and some cynicism from the well informed reader....that was all they could do without the ability to expand on demand for the subject matter....time the principles/laws in progress of development by me,is still in its infancy,,,suggesting some radical principles that come with more untested,and newly suggested observations,than most other,,,,so those who attempted to be fraudulent with my words,,did not only choose the newest least sought after subject,but also the least known,and scientifically credible author..(me)...made even more sad by the fact they failed,,,but i enjoyed their attention,and was flattered someone thought my work was that good,,,which of course i believe is much better,,,but not without the supporting paper work i have at home....]]></description>

Thanks.  Will duly note it in the text.  Doesn&#039;t save Zakaria though; his willingness to make the mistake once suggests it has probably happened before, whether he&#039;s been caught or not.  In my experience, people either never lie or lie regularly; a one-time lie is very rare.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zakaria&#039;s show &quot;Foreign Exchange&quot; was always amazingly insightful.  I&#039;d even say his was the single clearest, most useful voice on TV in that subject.  I don&#039;t know how you can plagiarize in-depth, on-the-spot conversation.  He&#039;s clearly a brilliant and well-educated man, and this incident doesn&#039;t change that, though it certainly does make me wonder how it happened.

Your &quot;happened before&quot; link doesn&#039;t seem like plagiarism to me though.  The way he phrased that, it was clear (to me, at least) that he was talking about an interview with someone else.  If he had meant an interview with him, he would have explicitly said that.  It would have been nice if he had remembered to say whose interview it was, but that still doesn&#039;t seem terribly out of line to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read the article, and all the sources you quoted. I also read &quot;How to write&quot; by Colson Whitehead, in the New York Times, which was funny and worth a peep.
 Plagiarism is a wretch of a thing. I&#039;ve been plagiarized in a way: I did a cartoon for a newspaper ad once, got paid for it, and when it appeared, the whole thing had been redrawn, by a cat, as Patrick O&#039;Brien might say..
And as my Mum told me, &quot;Tell the truth&quot;. Enough said.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of my classmates went on to do a masters in journalism, and he once got a phone call from another journo who wanted some advice on science.  My friend was happy to oblige, but as the conversation went on it became clear that the other journalist didn&#039;t have even the most basic understanding of science.  My friend suggested that he wasn&#039;t really qualified to write about science if he didn&#039;t even understand such basic things and the journalist then became indignant, asserting &quot;I don&#039;t need to be an expert on something to write about it!&quot;
It hints not so much at an &#039;instant expert&#039; attitude as one of &quot;All I have to do is regurgitate some words in the right order.&quot;  A computer could do as much.]]></description>
