					<description><![CDATA[Dont do this to us!!!  :)  :)

YES I DO want to know what physics packed into the rover.  And from the rest of the replies i read, so is everyone else!!

Pretty please!!???

					<description><![CDATA[1. Yes I am curious about the rover guts and everything!
2. It seems in America the funding has too short a lifetime for projects that go on for years.  The political landscape can change out from under the project.  It has all the effects noted above.  One of the key talents in these endeavors is to juggle contingencies.  (Open can of worms here.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The toolkit this rover carries is stunning in its sophistacation and (hopefully) its sensitivity and accuracy.  The landing has been an engineering (and computer software) tour de force.  But for the Curiosity landing, probably the main scientific input has been in the area of fluid dynamics: understanding and modeling how the capsule and parachute would behave in the relatively low but varying density of the Martian atmosphere at very high speed. At one point, while the heat shield was still attached, the capsule was at an angle of over 50 degrees and moving almost horizontally with respect to the surface, essentially flying and maneuvering like a hypersonic wing (it made at least two turns), all completely automated!  Very hard to test that on Earth!

My problem with the NASA budget is with the inadequacy of funding of actual science relative to &quot;show-piece&quot; projects.  NASA also does amazing engineering research in aeronautics as well as space, but all of that takes a back seat to the manned space flight sector -- which has very little to show for it for the last 20 years. Continuing to spend scarce funding on projects like maybe, someday landing a person on an asteroid, while cutting projects such as the joint European/NASA Exo-Mars and sample-return missions to Mars: this is where the whole process starts to seem ridiculous - since there is no scientific benefit, and little engineering advantage, to sending a human to bounce around on an asteroid.  Instead, although the James Web Space Telescope gets funding, NASA&#039;s planetary science budget for 2013 was cut by $300Million (20%); Mars exploration budgets were cut by 38%.  People with almost irreplaceable skill sets will be lost.  Other than the MAVEN orbiter for atmospheric study, the next Mars missions will probably be European and Russian - no U.S. involvement.  This is both a funding issue -- how to convince Congress and the non-scientific American public to devote tax dollars to NASA -- and just plain bad management at NASA.  When NASA gets &quot;punished&quot; for the latter by having its funding cut, it&#039;s almost always the science missions that take the biggest hit.  For the projects that do survive, it causes the delays and budget over-runs that Matt described.

By the way, the rovers are largely the product of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and its academic and industry partners in the U.S., Canada and Europe, not NASA per se.

Side note: the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (oscars.org) held an event on NASA Animation and the Movies last month, on the convergence (or not) of science, CG and cinema.  Aside from a star-studded audience (Buzz Aldrin was there) and a large-scale model of Curiosity, the most memorable images for me were the shots of Mars (in color, some in 3D, on a large screen) from the rovers and from the MRO and European orbiters.  Seeing erosion due to liquid flow actually happening in a gully on Mars, in photos from multiple orbiter passes spaced months apart - THAT was spectacular!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kinda of like the way in which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eskesthai.com/2012/08/mechanical-converted-sounds-of-operation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;experimental procedures&lt;/a&gt; are manufactured in order to fit our sensory data train. 

In this case I was watching the system make sounds as it ground the minerals and were deposited in the machine. It was a systemic feature of sonification that one could hear what was mechanically happening. Just as you might apply &lt;a href=&quot;http://lhcsound.hep.ucl.ac.uk/page_sonification/Sonification.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that method to the LHC.&lt;/a&gt;

Sure I think it&#039;s a much wider definition in terms of the parameters in the way in which we see but it still is an expectant quality that what we want to see fits those expectations? Calorimeters of course come to mind here.

How would you see beyond those parameters?

Best,]]></description>
