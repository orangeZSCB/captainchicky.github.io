Indeed.  I have a gut suspicion that the interweb is a game-changer due to its scope.  Never in the history of the world have so many been so connected.  McLuhan&#039;s &quot;global village&quot; has been with us for some time, now, and I think it&#039;s changing humanity.  Not sure if the change is ultimately Good, Bad or just Change, but I feel we are at a major social crossroads.]]></description>

As a general comment on modern society, I agree with your view.  But again, look at how American politics was carried out in the 19th century.  Things have gotten a bit worse recently, but they used to be a LOT worse.  Still, it would be nice to see them get better again.]]></description>

That&#039;s a good point, that the blogsphere is not likely to be representative of the whole.  Definitely a skewed sample! :)

I would agree that high intelligence often leads to confidence (or even arrogance), but I think those qualities can exist withOUT the immature and rude behaviors.  There are arrogant adults (many whom may have earned the right to some of that arrogance), and there are arrogant children.

Heated debate can be a wonderful, useful thing, but I wonder if modern society disdains polite interaction more than it ought.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/#comment-86239&quot;&gt;Wyrd Smythe&lt;/a&gt;.

The sad reality of human existence is that high intelligence does not correlate with high levels of maturity, politeness, wisdom or kindness.  In fact it often correlates with arrogance and self-assuredness, neither of which contributes to useful conversations.  I speak from personal experience; I know my own limitations.  In any case: scientists are just as human as everyone else, some of them are hot-heads, and some don&#039;t listen to or respect other people.

Blogging, specifically, attracts hot-heads... some of whom are well-meaning and have scientific integrity, others of whom have an axe to grind... and the reader has to beware.

It&#039;s still much, much better than in a lot of other subjects.  And it&#039;s a lot better than it used to be.  Go read what scientists used to say about each other 80 years ago...  Generally, people in this field DO respect each other&#039;s opinions even if they disagree.  Generally.  Not always.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was a happy day when I began discovering the various physics blogs written by real physicists talking about real physics.  (I was especially delighted to discover this site!)

It was an awful day when I began discovering that these physicists, these &lt;em&gt;scientists&lt;/em&gt; trained in logic and rationality, were acting like poorly trained children arguing over ice cream.  Mortifying!  I was ashamed on behalf of science.  And humanity.

If people with this level of education and training in thought and analysis can fall prey to such infantile behavior, what chance is there for the rest of the world to get it together?  What an awful, awful example to set.]]></description>
