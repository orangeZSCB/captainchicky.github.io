					<description><![CDATA[Problem is not with theories but with what people make with them. Our understanding of physics was thought to be profound but as always the universe finds a way to humble us and let us know that we are working hard but it is not enough. Our theories of the universe are not enough, if we had read about a thing called dark matter in a essay published in the 14th century we wouldnt be surprised for such a classification.... I guess that says most of what I think.... We must be humble regarding our knowledge. Physic laws are not broken, only our ideas.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While misrepresenting scientific events for sensationalistic purposes is a mainstay of media reporting, there are actual scientists out there who help to perpetuate such misrepresentation.  They regularly feed the media with
hyperbole, preferring to sacrifice scientific integrity for personal recognition and exposure.  What&#039;s especially harmful is that they are so-called &quot;media darlings&quot;, the ones the media constantly targets when there is any sort of scientific discovery that warrants clarification.]]></description>
