					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/technical-zone/#comment-14666&quot;&gt;mac&lt;/a&gt;.

Consciousness has nothing to do with working memory or the soul. A computer isn&#039;t conscious but a computer has a working memory. The soul is the mind. The quote, &quot;What profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul&quot;.  I talking about a man losing his mind not his consciousness.  Those who are not self-aware can never understand the meaning of the word consciousness. If you can feel pain and know that it is different than the knowledge of a loss you are conscious. If pain hurts you are conscious or consciousness. Your consciousness persists throughout your whole life while your memory does not. Your brain cells constantly change but your consciousness persists. The quarks and electrons in your body change but your consciousness persists. The consciousness is a place where sensations, thoughts, and feelings occur. It&#039;s evolutionary a place where the mind can run simulations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[REF: Las Campanas Observatory, Carnegie 
Discovery Image Aug 17, 2017 &#038; same Aug 21
from Matt Strassler&#039;s blog specifically 
https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/10/16/a-scientific-breakthrough-combining-gravitational-and-electromagnetic-waves/

simply copied image &#038; opened in Gimp then adjust Color Curves to highten color or reduce
black space, then compare 4 day images. 

Yes, neutron-neutron star merger turns from blue to red (comparison of images 4 days 
apart, but there&#039;s a seperate object roughly 180deg on other side of near by distant galaxy likely never involved with &#039;kilonova colllapse&#039; that is also showing same color 
transition, as does light signature of the galaxy itself, suggesting these images 4 days 
apart are not entirely equivalent, then only neutron-neutron signature would change, 
both galaxy &#038; object 180deg across should remain exactly identical in both images). 
It&#039;s as if this entire second image 4 days later has consistent color shift relative to 
the earlier image. I&#039;m only making one change to composite single image, so it seems 
either the first image is blue shifted or the second image 4 days later is red shifted, 
otherwise galaxy &#038; 2nd object shouldn&#039;t change, only the kilonova signature should color 
shift.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/technical-zone/#comment-364386&quot;&gt;Hess&lt;/a&gt;.

Physics is the study of the forces of nature.  Currently these are identified as Electromagnetism (EM), which holds together protons and electron clouds in atomic structure, whose force carriers are the bosons called photons, Electroweak, which binds nucleons (protons, neutrons) together, whose force carriers are the W and Z bosons, the Strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons, whose force carriers are gluons and color charge, and finally Gravitation, which currently fits no model of force carrier in the SM which makes any sense, or for which a force pair other than matter itself has been identified.  Gravitational waves of the gravitational force variety do propagate through empty space as acoustic (not associated with EM or other force) waves.  This coupling is extremely weak, generating displacements less than 1/1000 the diameter of a proton for a pair of merging black holes smaller than 100 times a solar mass.

Without understanding physics, we would not understand the behavior of the basic forces of nature.  We could not build bridges or massive structures,  exploit electronic telecommunication, enjoy modern air travel, launch satellites, build nuclear weapons to wage war (not really a beneficial application unless it deters it) or explore space.

What is the importance of physics?  This can only be answered with another questioh.  Relative to what other application of the human mind?  Without the physics of which our understanding is admittedly incomplete, we might as well all be imbeciles.]]></description>
