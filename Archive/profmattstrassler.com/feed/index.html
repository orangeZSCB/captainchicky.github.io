										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/">an experiment reported</a> that the magnetic properties of the muon, the electron&#8217;s middleweight cousin, are a tiny bit different from what particle physics equations say they should be.  All around the world, the headlines screamed: <strong>PHYSICS IS BROKEN!!!</strong> And indeed, it&#8217;s been pretty shocking to physicists everywhere. For instance, my equations are working erratically; many of the calculations I tried this weekend came out upside-down or backwards.  Even worse, my stove froze my coffee instead of heating it, I just barely prevented my car from floating out of my garage into the trees, and my desk clock broke and spilled time all over the floor.  What a mess!</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Broken, eh?  When we say a coffee machine or a computer is broken, it means it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s unavailable until it&#8217;s fixed.  When a glass is broken, it&#8217;s shattered into pieces.  We need a new one. I know it&#8217;s cute to say that so-and-so&#8217;s video &#8220;broke the internet.&#8221;  But aren&#8217;t we going a little too far now?  Nothing&#8217;s broken about physics; it works just as well today as it did a month ago.</p>



<p>More reasonable headlines have suggested that &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221;. That&#8217;s better; I know what it means to break a law.  (Though the metaphor is imperfect, since if I were to break a state law, I&#8217;d be punished, whereas if an object were to break a fundamental law of physics, that law would have to be revised!)  But as is true in the legal system, not all physics laws, and not all violations of law, are equally significant.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s a physics law, anyway? Crudely, physics is a strategy for making predictions about the behavior of physical objects, based on a set of equations <em>and</em> a conceptual framework for using those equations.  Sometimes we refer to the equations as laws; sometimes parts of the conceptual framework are referred to that way.  </p>



<p>But that story has layers.   Physics has an underlying conceptual foundation, which includes the pillar of quantum physics and its view of reality, and the pillar of Einstein&#8217;s relativity and its view of space and time.  (There are other pillars too, such as those of statistical mechanics, but let me not complicate the story now.) That foundation supports many research areas of physics.  Within particle physics itself, these two pillars are combined into a more detailed framework, with concepts and equations that go by the name of &#8220;quantum effective field theory&#8221; (&#8220;QEFT&#8221;).  But QEFT is still very <strong>general</strong>; this framework can describe an enormous number of possible universes, most with completely different particles and forces from the ones we have in our own universe.  We can start making predictions for real-world experiments only when we put the electron, the muon, the photon, and all the other familiar particles and forces into our equations, building up a <strong>specific</strong> example of a QEFT known as &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">The Standard Model of particle physics</a>.&#8221;  </p>



<p>All along the way there are equations and rules that you might call &#8220;laws.&#8221;  They too come in layers.  The Standard Model itself, as a specific QEFT, has few high-level laws: there are no principles telling us why quarks exist, why there is one type of photon rather than two, or why the weak nuclear force is so weak.  The few laws it does have are mostly low-level, true of our universe but not essential to it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m bringing attention to these layers because an experiment might cause a problem for one layer but not another.   I think you could only fairly suggest that &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; if data were putting a foundational pillar of the entire field into question.  And to say &#8220;the laws of physics have been violated&#8221;, emphasis on the word &#8220;<strong>the</strong>&#8220;, is a bit melodramatic if the only thing that&#8217;s been violated is a low-level, dispensable law.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Has physics, as a whole, <strong>ever</strong> broken?  You could argue that Newton&#8217;s 17th century foundation, which underpinned the next two centuries of physics, broke at the turn of the 20th century.   Just after 1900, Newton-style equations had to be replaced by equations of a substantially different type; the ways physicists used the equations changed, and the concepts, the language, and even the goals of physics changed. For instance, in Newtonian physics, you can predict the outcome of any experiment, at least in principle; in post-Newtonian quantum physics, you often can only predict the probability for one or another outcome, even in principle. And in Newtonian physics we all agree what time it is; in Einsteinian physics, different observers experience time differently and there is no universal clock that we all agree on.  These were immense changes in the foundation of the field.</p>



<p>Conversely, you could also argue that physics didn&#8217;t break; it was just remodeled and expanded.  No one who&#8217;d been studying steam engines or wind erosion or electrical circuit diagrams had to throw out their books and start again from scratch.  In fact this &#8220;broken&#8221; Newtonian physics is still taught in physics classes, and many physicists and engineers never use anything else.  If you&#8217;re studying the physics of weather, or building a bridge, Newtonian physics is just fine. The fact that Newton-style equations are an <strong>incomplete</strong> description of the world &#8212; that there are phenomena they can&#8217;t describe properly &#8212; doesn&#8217;t invalidate them when they&#8217;re applied within their wheelhouse.</p>



<p>No matter which argument you prefer, it&#8217;s hard to see how to justify the phrase &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; without a profound revolution that overthrows foundational concepts.  It&#8217;s rare for a serious threat to foundations to arise suddenly, because few experiments can single-handedly put fundamental principles at risk.  <em>[The infamous case of the &#8220;faster-than-light neutrinos&#8221; provides an exception.  Had that experiment been correct, it would have invalidated Einstein&#8217;s relativity principles. But few of us were surprised when <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/">a glaring error turned up</a>.]</em></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In the Standard Model, the electron, muon and tau particles (known as the &#8220;charged leptons&#8221;) are all identical except for their masses. <em>(More fundamentally, they have different interactions with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">the Higgs field</a>, from which their rest masses arise.)</em>  This almost-identity is sometimes stated as a &#8220;principle of lepton universality.&#8221;  <strong><em>Oh, wow, a principle &#8212; a law!</em></strong>  But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some principles are enormously important; the principles of Einsteinian relativity determine how cause and effect work in our universe, and you can&#8217;t drop them without running into big paradoxes.  Other principles are weak, and could easily be discarded without making a mess of any other part of physics.  The principle of lepton universality is one of these.   In fact, if you extend the Standard Model by adding new particles to its equations, it can be difficult to <em>avoid</em> ruining this fragile principle.  <em>[In a sense, the Higgs field has already violated the principle, but we don&#8217;t hold that against it.]</em></p>



<p>All the fuss is about a new experimental result which confirms an older one and slightly disagrees with the latest theoretical predictions, which are made using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.  What could be the cause of the discrepancy?  One possibility is that it arises from a previously unknown difference between muons and electrons &#8212; from a violation of the principle of lepton universality.  For those who live and breathe particle physics, breaking lepton universality would be a big deal; there&#8217;d be lots of adventure in trying to figure out which of the many possible extensions of the Standard Model could actually explain what broke this law. That&#8217;s why the scientists involved sound so excited.  </p>



<p>But the failure of  lepton universality wouldn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. From certain points of view, the surprise is that the principle has survived this long!  Since this low-level law is easily violated, its demise may not lead us to a profound new understanding of the world. It&#8217;s way too early for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/science/particle-physics-muon-fermilab-brookhaven.html">headlines that argue that what&#8217;s at stake is the existence of &#8220;forms of matter and energy vital to the nature and evolution of the cosmos.&#8221;</a> No one can say how much is at stake; it might be a lot, or just a little.</p>



<p>In particular, there&#8217;s absolutely <em>no</em> evidence that <strong><em>physics</em></strong> is broken, or even that <strong><em>particle physics</em></strong> is broken.  The pillars of physics and QEFT are not (yet) threatened.  Even to say that &#8220;<strong><em>the Standard Model </em></strong>might be broken&#8221; seems a bit melodramatic to me.  Does adding a new wing to a house require &#8220;breaking&#8221; the house? Typically you can still live in the place while it&#8217;s being extended. The Standard Model&#8217;s many successes suggest that it might survive largely intact as a recognizable part of a larger, more complete set of equations.</p>



<p>In any case, right now it&#8217;s still too early to say <strong>anything</strong> so loudly.  The apparent discrepancy may not survive the heavy scrutiny it is coming under. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/04/08/why-you-should-doubt-new-physics-from-the-latest-muon-g-2-results/?sh=4443b8616c4b">plenty of controversy</a> about the theoretical prediction for muon magnetism; the required calculation is extraordinarily complex, elaborate and difficult.  </p>



<p>So, from my perspective, the headlines of the past week are way over the top.  The idea that a single measurement of the muon&#8217;s magnetism could &#8220;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/muon-wobble-could-break-physics.html">shake physics to its core</a>&#8220;, as claimed in another headline I happened upon, is amusing at best.   Physics, and its older subdisciplines, have over time become very difficult to break, or even shake.  That&#8217;s the way it should be, when science is working properly.  And that&#8217;s why we can safely base the modern global economy on scientific knowledge; it&#8217;s unlikely that a single surprise could instantly invalidate large chunks of its foundation.</p>



<p>Some readers may view the extreme, click-baiting headlines as harmless.  Maybe I&#8217;m overly concerned about them. But don&#8217;t they implicitly suggest that one day we will suddenly find physics &#8220;upended&#8221;, and in need of a complete top-to-bottom overhaul?  To imply physics can &#8220;break&#8221; so easily makes a mockery of science&#8217;s strengths, and obscures the process by which scientific knowledge is obtained.  And how can it be good to claim &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; and &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221; over and over and over again, in stories that almost never merit that level of hype and eventually turn out to have been much ado about nada?  The constant manufacturing of scientific crisis cannot possibly be lost on readers, who I suspect are becoming increasingly jaded.   At some point readers may become as skeptical of science journalism, and the science it describes, as they are of advertising; <em>it&#8217;s all lies, so <strong>caveat emptor</strong></em>.   That&#8217;s not where we want our society to be.  As we are seeing in spades during the current pandemic, there can be serious consequences when &#8220;<strong>TRUST IN SCIENCE IS BROKEN!!!</strong>&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><em>A final footnote: Ironically, the Standard Model itself poses one of the biggest threats to the framework of QEFT. The discovery of the Higgs boson <strong>and nothing else (so far)</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider poses a conceptual challenge &#8212; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">&#8220;naturalness&#8221; problem</a>. There&#8217;s no sharp paradox, which is why I can&#8217;t promise you that the framework of QEFT will someday break if it isn&#8217;t resolved. But the breakdown of lepton universality might someday <strong>help</strong> solve the naturalness problem, by requiring a more &#8220;natural&#8221; extension of the Standard Model, and thus might actually <strong>save</strong> QEFT instead of &#8220;breaking&#8221; it.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/world/fifth-force-of-nature-scn-trnd/index.html">dramatic articles</a> in the news media suggesting that a Nobel Prize has essentially already been awarded for the amazing discovery of a &#8220;fifth force.&#8221; I thought I&#8217;d better throw some cold water on that fire; it&#8217;s fine for it to smoulder, but we shouldn&#8217;t let it overheat.</p>
<p>There could certainly be as-yet unknown forces waiting to be discovered &#8212; dozens of them, perhaps.   So far, there are four well-studied forces:<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/"> gravity, electricity/magnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force</a>.  Moreover, scientists are already fully confident <strong>there is a fifth force</strong>, predicted but not yet measured, that is generated by the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs field</a>. So the current story would really be about a <strong><em>sixth</em> </strong>force.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, any new force comes with at least one new particle.  That&#8217;s because</p>
<ul>
<li>every force arises from a type of field <em>(for instance, the electric force comes from the electromagnetic field, and the predicted Higgs force comes from the Higgs field)</em></li>
<li>and ripples in that type of field are a type of particle <em>(for instance, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">a minimal ripple</a> in the electromagnetic field is a photon &#8212; a particle of light &#8212; and a minimal ripple in the Higgs field is the particle known as the Higgs boson.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The current excitement, such as it is, arises because someone claims to have <strong>evidence for a new particle</strong>, whose properties would imply a previously unknown force exists in nature.  The force itself has not been looked for, much less discovered.</p>
<p>The new particle, if it really exists, would have a rest mass about 34 times larger than that of an electron &#8212; about 1/50th of a proton&#8217;s rest mass. In technical terms that means its E=mc² energy is about 17 million <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">electron volts</a> (MeV), and that&#8217;s why physicists are referring to it as the X17.  But the question is whether the two experiments that find evidence for it are correct.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01527">the first experiment, whose results appeared in 2015</a>, an experimental team mainly based in Debrecen, Hungary studied large numbers of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">nuclei</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium-8">beryllium-8</a> atoms, which had been raised to an &#8220;excited state&#8221; (that is, with more energy than usual).  An excited nucleus inevitably disintegrates, and the experimenters studied the debris.  On rare occasions they observed electrons and positrons [a.k.a. anti-electrons], and these behaved in a surprising way, as though they were produced in the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a> of a previously unknown particle.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459">newly reported experiment, whose results just appeared</a>, the same team observed  the disintegration of excited nuclei of helium.  They again found evidence for what they hope is the X17, and therefore claim confirmation of their original experiments on beryllium.</p>
<p>When two qualitatively different experiments claim the same thing, they are less likely to be wrong, because <strong><em>it&#8217;s not likely that any mistakes in the two experiments would create fake evidence of the same type</em></strong>.  On the face of it, it does seem unlikely that <strong>both</strong> measurements, carried out on two different nuclei, could fake an X17 particle.</p>
<p>However, we should remain cautious, because both experiments were carried out by the same scientists. They, of course, are hoping for their Nobel Prize (which, if their experiments are correct, they will surely win) and it&#8217;s possible they could suffer from unconscious bias. It&#8217;s very common for individual scientists to see what they want to see; scientists are human, and hidden biases can lead even the best scientists astray.  <strong>Only collectively, through the process of checking, reproducing, and using each other&#8217;s work, do scientists create trustworthy knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>So it is prudent to await efforts by other groups of experimenters to search for this proposed X17 particle.  If the X17 is observed by other experiments, then we&#8217;ll become confident that it&#8217;s real. But we probably won&#8217;t know until then.  I don&#8217;t currently know whether the wait will be months or a few years.</p>
<p>Why I am so skeptical? There are two distinct reasons.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s a conceptual, mathematical issue. It&#8217;s not easy to construct reasonable equations that allow the X17 to co-exist with all of the known types of elementary particles. That it has a smaller mass than a proton is not a problem per se.  But the X17 needs to have some unique and odd properties in order to (1)  be seen in these experiments, yet (2) not be seen in certain other previous experiments, some of which were explicitly looking for something similar.   To make equations that are consistent with these properties requires some complicated and not entirely plausible trickery.  Is it impossible? No.  But a number of the methods that scientists suggested were flawed, and the ones that remain are, to my eye, a bit contrived.</p>
<p>Of course, physics is an experimental science, and what theorists like me think doesn&#8217;t, in the end, matter.  If the experiments are confirmed, theorists will accept the facts and try to understand why something that seems so strange might be true.  But we&#8217;ve learned an enormous amount from mathematical thinking about nature in the last century &#8212; for instance, it was math that told us that the Higgs particle couldn&#8217;t be heavier than 1000 protons, and it was on the basis of that `advice&#8217; that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> was built to look for it (and it found it, in 2012.) Similar math led to the discoveries of the W and Z particles roughly where they were expected. So when the math tells you the X17 story doesn&#8217;t look good, it&#8217;s not reason enough for giving up, but it is reason for some pessimism.</p>
<p>Second, there are many cautionary tales in experimental physics. For instance, back in 2003 there were claims of evidence of a particle called a <em>pentaquark</em> with a rest mass about 1.6 times a proton&#8217;s mass &#8212; an exotic particle, made from quarks and gluons, that&#8217;s both like and unlike a proton.  Its existence was confirmed by multiple experimental groups!  Others, however, didn&#8217;t see it. It took several years for the community to come to the conclusion that this pentaquark, which looked quite promising initially, did not in fact exist.</p>
<p>The point is that mistakes do get made in particle hunts, sometimes in multiple experiments, and it can take some time to track them down. It&#8217;s far too early to talk about Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p><em>[Note that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">Higgs boson&#8217;s discovery</a> was accepted more quickly than most.  It was discovered simultaneously by two distinct experiments using two methods each, and confirmed by additional methods and in larger data sets soon thereafter.  Furthermore,  there were already straightforward equations that happily accommodated it, so it was much more plausible than the X17.] </em></p>
<p>And just for fun, here&#8217;s a third reason I&#8217;m skeptical. It has to do with the number 17. I mean, come on, guys, seriously &#8212; <strong>17</strong> million electron volts? This just isn&#8217;t auspicious.  Back when I was a student, in the late 1980s and early 90s, there was a set of experiments, by a well-regarded experimentalist, which showed considerable evidence for an additional neutrino with a E=mc² energy of <strong>17</strong> <em>thousand</em> electron volts. Other experiments tried to find it, but couldn&#8217;t. Yet no one could find a mistake in the experimenter&#8217;s apparatus or technique, and he had good arguments that the competing experiments had their own problems. Well, after several years, the original experimenter discovered that there was a piece of his equipment which unexpectedly could absorb about 17 keV of energy, faking a neutrino signal. It was a very subtle problem, and most people didn&#8217;t fault him since no one else had thought of it either. But that was the end of the 17 keV neutrino, and with it went hundreds of research papers by both experimental and theoretical physicists, along with one scientist&#8217;s dreams of a place in history.</p>
<p>In short, history is cruel to most scientists who claim important discoveries, and teaches us to be skeptical and patient. If there is a <del>fifth</del> <strong>sixth</strong> force, we&#8217;ll know within a few years. Don&#8217;t expect to be sure anytime soon. The knowledge cycle in science runs much, much slower than the twittery news cycle, and that&#8217;s no accident; if you want to avoid serious errors that could confuse you for a long time to come, <strong>don&#8217;t rush to judgment</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The untimely and sudden deaths of Steve Gubser and Ann Nelson, two of the United States&#8217; greatest talents in the theoretical physics of particles, fields and strings, has cast a pall over my summer and that of many of my colleagues.</p>
<p>I have not been finding it easy to write a proper memorial post for Ann, who was by turns my teacher, mentor, co-author, and faculty colleague.  I would hope to convey to those who never met her what an extraordinary scientist and person she was, but my spotty memory banks aren&#8217;t helping. Eventually I&#8217;ll get it done, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><em>(Meanwhile I am afraid I cannot write something similar for Steve, as I really didn&#8217;t know him all that well. I hope someone who knew him better will write about his astonishing capabilities and his unique personality, and I&#8217;d be more than happy to link to it from here.)</em></p>
<p>In this context, I&#8217;m gratified to see that the New York Times has given Ann a substantive obituary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/science/ann-nelson-dies.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/science/ann-nelson-dies.html</a>, and appearing in the August 28th print edition, I&#8217;m told. It contains a striking (but, to those of us who knew her, not surprising) quotation from Howard Georgi.  Georgi is a professor at Harvard who is justifiably famous as the co-inventor, with Nobel-winner Sheldon Glashow, of Grand Unified Theories (in which the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear force all emerge from a single force.) He describes Ann, his former student, as being able to best him at his own game.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I have had many fabulous students who are better than I am at many things. Ann was the only student I ever had who was better than I am at what I do best, and I learned more from her than she learned from me.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>He&#8217;s being a little modest, perhaps. But not much. There&#8217;s no question that Ann was an all-star.</p>
<p>And for that reason, I do have to complain about one thing in the Times obituary. It says &#8220;Dr. Nelson stood out in the world of physics not only because she was a woman, but also because of her brilliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really, NYTimes, really?!?</p>
<p>Any scientist who knew Ann would have said this instead: that Professor Nelson stood out in the world of physics for exceptional brilliance &#8212; lightning-fast, sharp, creative and careful, in the same league as humanity&#8217;s finest thinkers &#8212; and for remarkable character &#8212; kind, thoughtful, even-keeled, rigorous, funny, quirky, dogged, supportive, generous. Like most of us, Professor Nelson had a gender, too, which was female. There are dozens of female theoretical physicists in the United States; they are a too-small minority, but they aren&#8217;t rare. By contrast, a physicist and person like Ann Nelson, of <strong><em>any</em></strong> gender? They are extremely few in number across the entire planet, and they certainly do stand out.</p>
<p>But with that off my chest, I have no other complaints. (Well, admittedly the physics in the obit is rather garbled, but we can get that straight another time.) Mainly I am grateful that the Times gave Ann fitting public recognition, something that she did not actively seek in life. Her death is an enormous loss for theoretical physics, for many theoretical physicists, and of course for many other people. I join all my colleagues in extending my condolences to her husband, our friend and colleague David B. Kaplan, and to the rest of her family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is beyond belief that not only am I <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2018/02/05/a-brilliant-light-disappears-over-the-horizon-in-memory-of-joe-polchinski/">again writing a post about the premature death of a colleague whom I have known for decades</a>, but that I am doing it about two of them.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, two of the world&#8217;s most influential and brilliant theoretical high-energy physicists &#8212; Steve Gubser of Princeton University and Ann Nelson of the University of Washington &#8212; fell to their deaths in separate mountain accidents, one in the Alps and one in the Cascades.</p>
<p>Theoretical high energy physics is a small community, and within the United States itself the community is tiny.  Ann and Steve were both justifiably famous and highly respected as exceptionally bright lights in their areas of research. Even for those who had not met them personally, this is a stunning and irreplaceable loss of talent and of knowledge.</p>
<p>But most of us did know them personally.  For me, and for others with a personal connection to them, the news is devastating and tragic. I encountered Steve when he was a student and I was a postdoc in the Princeton area, and later helped bring him into a social group where he met his future wife (a great scientist in her own right, and a friend of mine going back decades).  As for Ann, she was one of my teachers at Stanford in graduate school, then my senior colleague on four long scientific papers, and then my colleague (along with her husband David B. Kaplan) for five years at the University of Washington, where she had the office next to mine. I cannot express what a privilege it always was to work with her, learn from her, and laugh with her.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the heart or energy right now to write more about this, but I will try to do so at a later time. Right now I join their spouses and families, and my colleagues, in mourning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>[Note Added: Thanks to some great comments I&#8217;ve received, I&#8217;m continuing to add clarifying remarks to this post.  You&#8217;ll find them in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>.]</strong></em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a couple of months since the `photo&#8217; <em>(<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">a false-color image created to show the intensity of radio waves, not visible light</a>) </em>of the black hole at the center of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87">the galaxy M87</a>, taken by the <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/">Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration</a>, was made public. Before it was shown, I wrote <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">an introductory post</a> explaining what the &#8216;photo&#8217; is and isn&#8217;t. There I cautioned readers that I thought it might be difficult to interpret the image, and controversies about it might erupt.<img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="10375" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/technical-zone/test-page/ehtdiscoverym87-3/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png" data-orig-size="800,466" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="EHTDiscoveryM87" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=500" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10375" src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300" alt="EHTDiscoveryM87" width="300" height="175" srcset="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300 300w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=600 600w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>So far, the claim that the image shows the vicinity of M87&#8217;s black hole (which I&#8217;ll call `M87bh&#8217; for short) has not been challenged, and I&#8217;m not expecting it to be. But what and where exactly is the material that is emitting the radio waves and thus creating the glow in the image? And what exactly determines the size of the dark region at the center of the image? These have been problematic issues from the beginning, but discussion is starting to heat up. <strong>And it&#8217;s important: it has implications for the measurement of the black hole&#8217;s mass</strong> (which <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab1141">EHT claims is that of 6.5 billion Suns, with an uncertainty of about 15%</a>),<strong> and for any attempt to estimate its rotation rate.</strong><span id="more-10382"></span></p>
<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve spent some time studying the mathematics of spinning black holes, talking to my Harvard colleagues who are world&#8217;s experts on the relevant math and physics, and learning from colleagues who produced the `photo&#8217; and interpreted it. So I think I can now clearly explain what most journalists and scientist-writers (including me) got wrong at the time of the photo&#8217;s publication, and clarify what the photo does and doesn&#8217;t tell us.</p>
<p>One note before I begin: this post is long. But it starts with a summary of the situation that you can read quickly, and then comes the long part: a step-by-step non-technical explanation of an important aspect of the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217; that, to my knowledge, has not yet been given anywhere else.</p>
<p><em>[I am heavily indebted to Harvard postdocs Alex Lupsasca and Shahar Hadar for assisting me as I studied the formulas and concepts relevant for fast-spinning black holes. Much of what I learned comes from early 1970s papers, especially those by my former colleague Professor Jim Bardeen (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..347B/abstract">see this one written with Press and Teukolsky</a>), and from papers written in the last couple of years, especially <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11112">this one</a> by my present and former Harvard colleagues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>What Does the EHT Image Show?</strong></p>
<p>Scientists understand the black hole itself &#8212; the geometric dimple in space and time &#8212; pretty well. If one knows the mass and the rotation rate of the black hole, and assumes Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity are mostly correct <em>(for which we have considerable evidence, for example <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/06/15/ligo-detects-a-second-merger-of-black-holes/">from LIGO measurements</a> and elsewhere), </em>then the equations tell us what the black hole does to space and time and how its gravity works.</p>
<p>But for the `photo&#8217;, ​that&#8217;s not enough information. We don&#8217;t get to observe the black hole itself (it&#8217;s black, after all!) What the `photo&#8217; shows is a blurry ring of radio waves, emitted from hot material (a <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/plasma">plasma</a> of mostly electrons and protons) <strong>somewhere around</strong> the black hole &#8212; material whose location, velocity, and temperature we do not know. That material and its emission of radio waves are influenced by powerful gravitational forces (whose details depend on the rotation rate of the M87bh, which we don&#8217;t know yet) and powerful magnetic fields (whose details we hardly know at all.) The black hole&#8217;s gravity then causes the paths on which the radio waves travel to bend, even more than a glass lens will bend the path of visible light, so that <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">where things appear in the &#8216;photo&#8217; is not where they are actually located.</a></p>
<p>The only insights we have into this extreme environment come from computer simulations and a few other `photos&#8217; at lower magnification. The simulations are based on well-understood equations, but the equations have to be solved approximately, using methods that may or may not be justified. And the simulations don&#8217;t tell you where the matter <strong><em>is</em></strong>; they tell you where the material <em><strong>will go, </strong></em>but only <strong>after you make a guess</strong> as to where it is located at some initial point in time. <em>(In the same sense: computers can predict the national weather tomorrow only when you tell them what the national weather was yesterday.)</em> No one knows for sure how accurate or misleading these simulations might be; they&#8217;ve been tested against some indirect measurements, but no one can say for sure what flaws they might have.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing we can certainly say, and it has just been said publicly in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00873">a paper by Samuel Gralla, Daniel Holz and Robert Wald</a>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Two months ago, when the EHT `photo&#8217; appeared, it was widely reported in the popular press and on blogs that the photo shows the image of a <strong>photon sphere</strong> at the edge of the <strong>shadow</strong> of the M87bh. <em>(Instead of `shadow&#8217;, I suggested the term &#8216;<strong>quasi-silhouette</strong>&#8216;, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/"> which I viewed as somewhat less misleading to a non-expert.</a>) </em></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Unfortunately, it seems these statements are not true; and this was well-known to (but poorly communicated by, in my opinion) the EHT folks.  This lack of clarity might perhaps annoy some scientists and science-loving non-experts; but does this issue also matter scientifically? Gralla et al., in their new preprint, suggest that it does (though they were careful to not yet make a precise claim.)</span></p>
<p><strong>The Photon Sphere Doesn&#8217;t Exist</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>Indeed, if you happened to be reading my posts carefully when the `photo&#8217; first appeared, you probably noticed that I was quite vague about the photon-sphere &#8212; I never defined precisely what it was. You would have been right to read this as a warning sign, for indeed I wasn&#8217;t getting clear explanations of it from anyone. Studying the equations and conversing with expert colleagues, I soon learned why: <em><strong>for a rotating black hole, the photon sphere doesn&#8217;t really exist.</strong></em></p>
<p>But let&#8217;s first define what the photon sphere is for a non-rotating black hole! Like the Earth&#8217;s equator, the photon sphere is a location, not an object. This location is the surface of an imaginary ball, lying well outside the black hole&#8217;s horizon. On the photon sphere, photons (the particles that make up light, radio waves, and all other electromagnetic waves) travel on special circular or spherical orbits around the black hole.</p>
<p>By contrast, a rotating black hole has a larger, broader `photon-zone&#8217; where photons can have special orbits. But you won&#8217;t ever see the whole photon zone in any image of a rotating black hole. Instead, a piece of the photon zone will appear as a `<em><strong>photon ring</strong></em>&#8216;, a bright and very thin loop of radio waves. However,<span style="color:#800080;"> the photon ring is <strong>not</strong> the edge of anything spherical, is generally <strong>not</strong> perfectly circular, and generally is <strong>not</strong> even perfectly centered on the black hole</span><em><span style="color:#800080;">.</span><br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>&#8230; and the Photon Ring Isn&#8217;t What We See&#8230;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It seems likely that the M87bh is rotating quite rapidly, so it has a photon-zone rather than a photon-sphere, and images of it will have a photon ring. Ok, fine; but then, can we interpret EHT&#8217;s `photo&#8217; simply as showing the photon ring, blurred by the imperfections in the `telescope&#8217;? Although some of the EHT folks have seemed to suggest the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;, Gralla et al. suggest the answer is likely &#8220;no&#8221; <em>(and many of their colleagues have been pointing out the same thing in private.)</em> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>The circlet of radio waves that appears in the EHT `photo&#8217; is probably not simply a blurred image of M87bh&#8217;s photon ring; it probably shows a combination of the photon ring with something brighter </strong>(as explained below).</em></span> That&#8217;s where the controversy starts.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;so the Dark Patch May Not Be the Full Shadow&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The term `shadow&#8217; is confusing (which is why I prefer `quasi-silhouette&#8217; in describing it in public contexts, though that&#8217;s my own personal term) but no matter what you call it, in its ideal form it is supposed to be an absolutely dark area whose edge is the photon ring. But in reality the perfectly dark area need not appear so dark after all; it may be partly filled in by various effects. Furthermore, since the `photo&#8217; may not show us the photon ring, it&#8217;s far from clear that the dark patch in the center is the full shadow anyway. The EHT folks are well aware of this, but at the time the photo came out, many science writers and scientist-writers (including me) were not.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;so EHT&#8217;s Measurement of the M87bh&#8217;s Mass is Being Questioned</strong></p>
<p>It was wonderful that EHT could make a picture that could travel round the internet at the speed of light, and generate justifiable excitement and awe that human beings could indirectly observe such an amazing thing as a black hole with a mass of several billion Sun-like stars. Qualitatively, they achieved something fantastic in showing that yes, the object at the center of M87 really is as compact and dark as such a black hole would be expected to be! But the EHT telescope&#8217;s main <strong><em>quantitative</em></strong> achievement was <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab1141">a measurement of the mass of the M87bh</a>, with a claimed precision of about 15%.</p>
<p>Naively, one could imagine that the mass is measured by looking at the diameter of the dark spot in the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217;, under the assumption that it is the black hole&#8217;s shadow. So here&#8217;s the issue: <em><strong>Could interpreting the dark region incorrectly perhaps lead to a significant mistake in the mass measurement, and/or an underestimate of how uncertain the mass measurement actually is?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.  The EHT folks are certainly aware of these issues; their simulations show them explicitly.  The mass of the M87bh isn&#8217;t literally measured by putting a ruler on the &#8216;photo&#8217; and measuring the size of the dark spot! The actual methods are much more sophisticated than that, and I don&#8217;t understand them well enough yet to explain, evaluate or criticize them. All I can say with confidence right now is that these are important questions that experts currently are debating, and consensus on the answer may not be achieved for quite a while.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>The Appearance of a Black Hole With Nearby Matter</strong></p>
<p>Ok, now I&#8217;m going to explain the most relevant points, step-by-step. Grab a cup of coffee or tea, find a comfy chair, and bear with me.</p>
<p>Because fast-rotating black holes are more complicated, I&#8217;m going to start illuminating the controversy by looking at a <strong>non-rotating</strong> black hole&#8217;s properties, which is also what Gralla et al. mainly do in their paper. It turns out the qualitative conclusion drawn from the non-rotating case largely applies in the rotating case too, at least in the case of the M87bh as seen from our perspective; that&#8217;s important because the M87bh may well be rotating at a very good clip.</p>
<p>A little terminology first: for a rotating black hole there&#8217;s a natural definition of the poles and the equator, just as there is for the Earth: there&#8217;s an axis of rotation, and the poles are where that axis intersects with the black hole horizon. The equator is the circle that lies halfway between the poles. For a non-rotating black hole, there&#8217;s no such axis and no such automatic definition, but it will be useful to define the north pole of the black hole to be the point on the horizon closest to us.</p>
<p><strong>A Single Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine placing a bright light bulb on the same plane as the equator, outside the black hole horizon but rather close to it. <em>(The bulb could emit radio waves or visible light or any other form of electromagnetic waves, at any frequency; for what I&#8217;m about to say, it doesn&#8217;t matter at all, so I&#8217;ll just call it `light&#8217;.)</em> See Figure 1. Where will the light from the bulb go?</p>
<p>Some of it, heading inward, ends up in the black hole, while some of it heads outward toward distant observers. The gravity of the black hole will bend the path of the light. And here&#8217;s something remarkable: a small fraction of the light, aimed just so, can actually spiral around the black hole any number of times before heading out. As a result, you will see the bulb not once but multiple times!</p>
<p>There will be a direct image &#8212; light that comes directly to us &#8212; from near the bulb&#8217;s true location (displaced because gravity bends the light a bit, just as a glass lens will distort the appearance of what&#8217;s behind it.) That path of that light is the orange arrow in Figure 1. But then there will be an <strong>indirect</strong> image (the green arrow in Figure 1) from light that goes halfway around the black hole before heading in our direction; we will see that image of the bulb on the opposite side of the black hole. Let&#8217;s call that the `first indirect image.&#8217; Then there will be a second indirect image from light that orbits the black hole once and comes out near the direct image, but further out; that&#8217;s the blue arrow in Figure 1. Then there will be a third indirect image from light that goes around one and a half times (not shown), and so on. In short, Figure 1 shows the paths of the direct, first indirect, and second indirect images of the bulb as they head toward our location at the top of the image.</p>

For light to make orbits of the black hole, it must travel near the grey-dashed circle that indicates the location of a &#8220;photon-sphere.&#8221; (A rotating black hole has no such sphere, but when seen from the north or south pole, the light observed takes similar paths to what is shown in this figure.) <em>[The paths of the light rays were calculated carefully using Mathematica 11.3.]</em></p></div>What you can see in Figure 1 is that both the first and second indirect images are formed by light that spends part of its time close to a special radius around the back hole, shown as a dotted line. This imaginary surface, the edge of a ball,  is an honest &#8220;photon-sphere&#8221; in the case of a <strong><em>non-rotating</em></strong> black hole.</p>
<p>In the case of a <strong><em>rotating</em></strong> black hole, something very similar happens <strong>when you&#8217;re looking at the black hole from its north (or south) pole</strong>; there&#8217;s a special circle then too. But that circle is <em><strong>not</strong></em> the edge of a photon-sphere! In general, photons can have special orbits in a wide region, which I called the &#8220;photon-zone&#8221; earlier, and only a small set of them are on this circle. You&#8217;ll see photons from other parts of the photon zone if you look at the black hole not from the poles but from some other angle.</p>
<p><em>[If you&#8217;d like to learn a bit more about the photon zone, and you have a little bit of knowledge of black holes already, you can profit from exploring this demo by Professor Leo Stein: <a href="https://duetosymmetry.com/tool/kerr-circular-photon-orbits/">https://duetosymmetry.com/tool/kerr-circular-photon-orbits/</a> ]</em></p>
<p>Back to the non-rotating case: What our camera will see, looking at what is emitted from the light bulb, is shown in Figure 2: an infinite number of increasingly squished `indirect&#8217; images, half on one side of the black hole near the direct image, and the other half on the other side. What is not obvious, but true, is that only the first of the indirect images is large and bright; this is one of Gralla <em>et al.</em>&#8216;s main points. We can, therefore, separate the images into the direct image, the first indirect image, and the remaining indirect images. The total amount of light coming from the direct image and the first indirect image can be large, but the total amount of light from the remaining indirect images is typically (according to Gralla <em>et al.</em>) less than 5% of the light from the first indirect image. And so, unless we have an extremely high-powered camera, we&#8217;ll never pick those other images up. <strong>Let&#8217;s therefore focus our attention on the direct image and the first indirect image.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Circular Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>Proceeding step by step toward a more realistic situation, let&#8217;s replace our ordinary bulb by a circular bulb (Figure 3), again set somewhat close to the horizon, sitting in the plane that contains the equator. What would we see now?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s shown in Figure 4: the direct image is a circle (looking somewhat larger than it really is); outside it sits the first indirect image of the ring; and then come all the other indirect images, looking quite dim and all piling up at one radius. We&#8217;re going to call all those piled-up images the &#8220;photon ring&#8221;.</p>

<p>Importantly, if we consider circular bulbs of different diameter [yellow, red and blue in Figure 5], then although the direct images reflect the differences in the bulbs&#8217; diameters (somewhat enlarged by lensing), the first indirect images <strong>all are about the same diameter</strong>, just a tad larger or smaller than the photon ring.  The remaining indirect images all sit together at the radius of the photon ring.</p>

<p>These statements are also essentially true for a rotating black hole seen from the north or south pole; a circular bulb generates a series of circular images, and the indirect images all pile more or less on top of each other, forming a photon ring. When viewed off the poles, the rotating black hole becomes a more complicated story, but as long as the viewing angle is small enough, the changes are relatively minor and the picture is qualitatively somewhat similar.</p>
<p><strong>A Disk as a Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>And what if you replaced the circular bulb with a disk-shaped bulb, a sort of glowing pancake with a circular hole at its center, as in Figure 7? That&#8217;s relevant because black holes are thought to have `accretion disks&#8217; made of material orbiting the black hole, and eventually spiraling in. The accretion disk may well be the dominant source emitting radio waves at the M87bh. <em>(I&#8217;m showing a very thin uniform disk for illustration, but a real accretion disk is not uniform, changes rapidly as clumps of material move within it and then spiral into the black hole, and may be quite thick &#8212; as thick as the black hole is wide, or even thicker.)</em></p>
<p>Well, we can think of the disk as many concentric circles of light placed together. The direct images of the disk (shown in Figure 6 left, on one side of the disk, as an orange wash) would form a disk in your camera, the dim red region in Figure 6 right; the hole at its center would appear larger than it really is due to the bending caused by the black hole&#8217;s gravity, but the shape would be similar. However, the indirect images would all pile up in almost the same place from your perspective, forming a bright and quite thin ring, the bright yellow circle in Figure 6 right. (The path of the disk&#8217;s first indirect image is shown in Figure 6 left, going halfway about the black hole as a green wash; notice how it narrows as it travels, which is why it appears as a narrow ring in the image at right.) This circle &#8212; the full set of indirect images of the whole disk &#8212; is the edge of the photon-sphere for a non-rotating black hole, and the circular photon ring for a rotating black hole viewed from its north or south pole.</p>

The direct image of the disk forms a disk (illustrated at left, for a piece of the disk, as an orange wash) while the first indirect image becomes highly compressed (illustrated, for a piece of the disk, as a green wash) and is seen as a narrow circle of bright light.  <em><span style="color:#008000;">(It is expected that the disk is mostly transparent in radio waves, so the indirect image can pass through it.)</span></em> That circle, along with the other indirect images, forms the photon ring. In this case, because the disk&#8217;s inner edge lies close to the black hole horizon, the photon ring sits within the disk&#8217;s direct image, but we&#8217;ll see a different example in Figure 9.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[Gralla et al. call the first indirect image the `lensed ring&#8217; and the remaining indirect images, currently unobservable at EHT, the `photon ring&#8217;, while EHT refers to <strong>all</strong> the indirect images as the `photon ring&#8217;. Just letting you know in case you hear `lensed ring&#8217; referred to in future.]</em></span></p>
<p>So the conclusion is that if we had a perfect camera, the direct image of a disk makes a disk, but the indirect images (mainly just the first one, as Gralla et al. emphasize) make a bright, thin ring that may be superposed upon the direct image of the disk, depending on the disk&#8217;s shape.</p>
<p>And this conclusion, with some important adjustments, applies also for a spinning black hole viewed from above its north or south pole &#8212; i.e., along its axis of rotation &#8212; or from near that axis; I&#8217;ll mention the adjustments in a moment.</p>
<p>But EHT is not a perfect camera. To make the black hole image, technology had to be pushed to its absolute limits. Someday we&#8217;ll see both the disk and the ring, but right now, they&#8217;re all blurred together. So which one is more important?</p>
<p><strong>From a Blurry Image to Blurry Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>What does a blurry camera do to this simple image? You might think that the disk is so dim and the ring so bright that the camera will mainly show you a blurry image of the bright photon ring. But that&#8217;s wrong. The ring isn&#8217;t bright enough. A simple calculation reveals that the ​photo will show mainly the disk, not the photon ring! This is shown in Figure 9, which you can compare with the Black Hole `photo&#8217; (Figure 10). <em>(Figure 9 is symmetric around the ring, but the photo is not, for multiple reasons &#8212; Doppler-like effect from rotation, viewpoint off the rotation axis, etc. &#8212; which I&#8217;ll have to defer til another post.)</em></p>

Its accretion disk has an unknown size and shape — it may be quite thick and non-uniform — and it may not even lie at the black hole’s equator. The disk and the black hole interact to create outward-going jets of material (observed already many years ago but not clearly visible in the EHT ‘photo’.) (Right) The EHT `photo’ of the M87bh (taken in radio waves and shown in false color!) Compare with Figure 7; the most important difference is that one side of the image is brighter than the other. This likely arises from (a) our view being slightly off from the south pole, combined with (b) rotation of the black hole and its disk, and (c) possibly other more subtle issues.</p></div></p>
<p>This is important. The photon ring&#8217;s diameter, and thus the width of the `shadow&#8217; too, barely depend on the rotation rate of the black hole; they depend almost exclusively on the black hole&#8217;s mass. So <em><strong>if the ring in the photo were simply the photon ring of the M87bh, you&#8217;d have a very simple way to measure the black hole&#8217;s mass without knowing its rotation rate</strong></em>: you&#8217;d look at how large the dark patch is, or equivalently, the diameter of the blurry ring, and that would give you the answer to within 10%. But it&#8217;s nowhere near so simple if the blurry ring shows the accretion disk, because the accretion disk&#8217;s properties and appearance can vary much more than the photon ring; they can depend strongly on the black hole&#8217;s rotation rate, and also on magnetic fields and other details of the black hole&#8217;s vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>The Important Role of Rotation</strong></p>
<p>If we conclude that EHT is seeing a mix of the accretion disk with the photon ring, with the former dominating the brightness, then this makes EHT&#8217;s measurement of the M87bh&#8217;s mass more confusing and even potentially suspect. Hence: controversy. Is it possible that EHT underestimated their uncertainties, and that their measurement of the black hole mass has more ambiguities, and is not as precise, as they currently claim?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the rotation rate is important. <span style="color:#008000;">Despite what I showed (for pedagogical simplicity) in Figure 7</span>, for a non-rotating black hole the accretion disk&#8217;s central gap is <span style="color:#008000;">actually</span> expected to lie <strong>outside</strong> the photon ring; this is shown at the top of Figure 9.  But  the faster the black hole rotates, the smaller this central gap is expected to be, to the point that for a fast-rotating black hole the gap will lie <strong>inside</strong> the photon ring, <span style="color:#008000;">as shown at the bottom of Figure 9.</span> <em>(This tendency is not obvious; it requires understanding details of the black hole geometry.)</em> And if that is true, the dark patch in the EHT image may not be the black hole&#8217;s full shadow (i.e. quasi-silhouette), which is the region inside the photon ring. <strong>It may be just the inner portion of it, with the outer portion obscured by emission from the accretion disk.</strong></p>
<p>The <span style="color:#008000;">effect of blurring in the</span> two cases of slow (or zero) and fast rotation are illustrated in Figure 9, where the photon ring&#8217;s size is taken to be the same in each case but the disk&#8217;s inner edge is close in or far out. (The black holes, not illustrated since they aren&#8217;t visible anyway, differ in mass by about 10% in order to have the photon ring the same size.) This shows why the size of the dark patch can be quite different, depending on the disk&#8217;s shape, even when the photon ring&#8217;s size is the same.</p>

(Left) the view in a perfect camera; (right) rough illustration of the effect of blurring in the current version of the EHT. The faster the black hole is spinning, the smaller the central gap in the accretion disk is likely to be. No matter what the extent of the accretion disk (dark red), the photon ring (yellow) remains at roughly the same location, changing only by 10% between a non-rotating black hole and a maximally rotating black hole of the same mass. But blurring in the camera combines the disk and photon ring into a thick ring whose brightness is dominated by the disk rather than the ring, and which can therefore be of different size even though the mass is the same. This implies that the radius of the blurry ring in the EHT `photo’, and the size of the dark region inside it, cannot by themselves tell us the black hole’s mass; at a minimum we must also know the rotation rate (which we do not.)</p></div></p>
<p>Gralla et al. subtly raise these questions but are careful not to overstate their case, perhaps because they have not yet completed their study of rotating black holes. But the question is now in the air.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested to hear what the EHT folks have to say about it, as I&#8217;m sure they have detailed arguments in favor of their procedures. In particular, <strong>EHT&#8217;s simulations show all of the effects mentioned above; there&#8217;s none of this of which they are unaware.</strong> (In fact, the reason I know my illustrations above are reasonable is partly because you can see similar pictures <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0f43">in the EHT papers.</a>) As long as the EHT folks correctly accounted for all the issues, then they should have been able to properly measure the mass and estimate their uncertainties correctly. <strong><em>In fact, they don&#8217;t really use the photo itself; they use more subtle techniques applied to their telescope data directly. </em></strong>Thus it&#8217;s not enough to argue the photo itself is ambiguous; one has to argue that EHT&#8217;s more subtle analysis methods are flawed. No one has argued that yet, as far as I am aware.</p>
<p>But the one thing that&#8217;s clear right now is that science writers almost uniformly got it wrong <em>[because the experts didn&#8217;t explain these points well]</em> when they tried to describe the image two months ago. The `photo&#8217; probably does not show &#8220;a photon ring surrounding a shadow.&#8221; That would be nice and simple and impressive-sounding, since it refers to fundamental properties of the black hole&#8217;s warping effects on space. But it&#8217;s far too glib, as Figures 7 and 9 show. We&#8217;re probably seeing an accretion disk supplemented by a photon ring, all blurred together, and the dark region may well be smaller than the black hole&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p><em>(Rather than, or in addition to, the accretion disk, it is also possible that the dominant emission in the photo comes from the inner portion of one of the jets that emerges from the vicinity of the black hole; see Figure 8 above. This is another detail that makes the situation more difficult to interpret, but doesn&#8217;t change the main point I&#8217;m making.)</em></p>
<p>Someday in the not distant future, improved imaging should allow EHT to separately image the photon ring and the disk, so both can be observed easily, as in the left side of Figure 9. Then all these questions will be answered definitively.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Gargantua Black Hole from <em>Interstellar</em> is Completely Different</strong></p>
<p>Just as a quick aside, what would you see if an accretion disk were edge-on rather than face-on? Then, in a perfect camera, you&#8217;d see something like the famous picture of Gargantua, the black hole from the movie <em>Interstellar</em> &#8212; a direct image of the front edge of the disk, and a strongly lensed indirect image of the back side of the disk, appearing both above and below the black hole, as illustrated in Figure 11. And that leads to the Gargantua image from the movie, also shown in Figure 11. Notice the photon ring (which is, as I cautioned you earlier, off-center!)   <em><span style="color:#339966;">[Note added: this figure has been modified; in the original version I referred to the top and bottom views of the disk&#8217;s far side as the  &#8220;1st indirect image&#8221;, but as pointed out by Professor Jean-Pierre Luminet, that&#8217;s not correct terminology here.]</span> </em></p>

As a result, the direct image of the disk cuts across the black hole, and indirect images of the back side of the disk are seen above and below the black hole. There is also a bright photon ring, slightly off center; this is well outside the surface of the black hole, which is not visible. A real image would not be symmetric left-to-right; it would be brighter on the side that is rotating toward the viewer.  <span style="color:#339966;">At the bottom is shown a much more realistic visual image (albeit not so good quality) from 1994 by Jean-Alain Marck, in which this asymmetry can be seen clearly.</span></p></div></p>
<p>However, the movie image leaves out an important Doppler-like effect (which I&#8217;ll explain someday when I understand it 100%). This makes the part of the disk that is rotating toward us bright, and the part rotating away from us dim&#8230; and so a real image from this vantage point would be very asymmetric &#8212; bright on the left, dim on the right &#8212; unlike the movie image. <span style="color:#339966;"> At the suggestion of Professsor Jean-Pierre Luminet I have added, at the bottom of Figure 10, a very early simulation by Jean-Alain Marck that shows this effect.</span></p>
<p>I mention this because a number of expert science journalists incorrectly explained the M87 image by referring to Gargantua &#8212; but that image has essentially <em><strong>nothing</strong></em> to do with the recent black hole `photo&#8217;. M87&#8217;s accretion disk is certainly not edge-on. The movie&#8217;s Gargantua image is taken from the equator, not from near the pole.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks: Where a Rotating Black Hole Differs from a Non-Rotating One<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Before I quit for the week, I&#8217;ll just summarize a few big differences for fast-rotating black holes compared to non-rotating ones.</p>
<p>1) As I&#8217;ve just emphasized, what a rotating black hole looks like to a distant observer depends not only on where the matter around the black hole is located but also on how the black hole&#8217;s rotation axis is oriented relative to the observer. A pole observer, an equatorial observer, and a near-pole observer see quite different things. (As noted in Figure 8, we are apparently near-south-pole observers for M87&#8217;s black hole.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the accretion disk lies in the same plane as the black hole&#8217;s equator &#8212; there are some reasons to expect this. Even then, the story is complex.</p>
<p>2) As I mentioned above, instead of a photon-sphere, there is a &#8216;photon-zone&#8217; &#8212; a region where specially aimed photons can travel round the black hole multiple times. For high-enough spin (greater than about 80% of maximum as I recall), an accretion disk&#8217;s inner edge can lie within the photon zone, or even closer to the black hole than the photon zone; and this can cause a filling-in of the &#8216;shadow&#8217;.</p>
<p>3) Depending on the viewing angle, the indirect images of the disk that form the photon ring may not be a circle, and may not be concentric with the direct image of the disk. Only when viewed from along the rotation axis (i.e., above the north or south pole) will the direct and indirect images of the disk all be circular and concentric. We&#8217;re not viewing the M87bh on its axis, and that further complicates interpretation of the blurry image.</p>
<p>4) When the viewing angle is not along the rotation axis the image will be asymmetric, brighter on one side than the other. (This is true of EHT&#8217;s `photo&#8217;.) However, I know of at least four potential causes of this asymmetry, any or all of which might play a role, and the degree of asymmetry depends on properties of the accretion disk and the rotation rate of the black hole, both of which are currently unknown. Claims about the asymmetry made by the EHT folks seem, at least to me, to be based on certain assumptions that I, at least, cannot currently check.</p>
<p>Each of these complexities is a challenge to explain, so I&#8217;ll give both you and I a substantial break while I figure out how best to convey what is known (at least to me) about these issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">THIS POST CONTAINS ERRORS CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE AND VISIBILITY OF THE SO-CALLED PHOTON-SPHERE AND SHADOW; THESE ERRORS WERE COMMON TO ESSENTIALLY ALL REPORTING ON THE BLACK HOLE &#8216;PHOTO&#8217;.  IT HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">THIS POST</a>, WHICH CORRECTS THESE ERRORS AND EXPLAINS THE SITUATION.</span></strong></p>
<p>Ok, after <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/15/the-black-hole-photo-what-are-we-looking-at/">yesterday&#8217;s post, in which I told you what I still didn&#8217;t understand about the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) black hole image</a> (see also <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">the pre-photo blog post</a> in which I explained pedagogically what the image was likely to show and why), today I can tell you that quite a few of the gaps in my understanding are filling in <em>(thanks mainly to conversations with Harvard postdoc Alex Lupsasca and science journalist Davide Castelvecchi, and to direct answers from professor Heino Falcke, who leads the Event Horizon Telescope Science Council and co-wrote <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/312423/fulltext/">a founding paper in this subject</a>)</em>.  And I can give you an update to yesterday&#8217;s very tentative figure.</p>
<p>First: a very important point, to which I will return in a future post, is that as I suspected, <strong><em>it&#8217;s not at all clear what the EHT image really shows.</em></strong>   More precisely, assuming Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity is correct in this context:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image itself <del>clearly shows a black hole&#8217;s quasi-silhouette (called a `shadow&#8217; in expert jargon) and its bright photon-sphere</del> where photons [particles of light &#8212; of all electromagnetic waves, including radio waves] can be gathered and focused.</li>
<li>However, all the light (including the observed radio waves) coming from the photon-sphere was emitted from material <del><em><strong>well outside</strong></em> the photon-sphere</del>; and <strong>the image itself does not tell you where that material is located.</strong>  <em>(To quote Falcke: this is `a blessing and a curse&#8217;; insensitivity to the illumination source makes it <del>easy to interpret the black hole&#8217;s role in the image</del> but hard to learn much about the material near the black hole.)</em> It&#8217;s a bit analogous to seeing a brightly shining metal ball while not being able to see what it&#8217;s being lit by&#8230; except that the photon-sphere isn&#8217;t an object.  It&#8217;s just a result of the play of the light [well, radio waves] directed by the bending effects of gravity.  More on that in a future post.</li>
<li>When you see a picture of an accretion disk and jets drawn to illustrate where the radio waves may come from, <strong><em>keep in mind that it involves additional assumptions</em></strong> &#8212; educated assumptions that combine many other measurements of M87&#8217;s black hole with simulations of matter, gravity and magnetic fields interacting near a black hole.  But we should be cautious: perhaps not all the assumptions are right.  The image shows no conflicts with those assumptions, but neither does it confirm them on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to indicate the importance of these assumptions, let me highlight a remark made at the press conference that the black hole is rotating quickly, clockwise from our perspective.  But (as the EHT papers state) <strong><em>if one doesn&#8217;t make some of the above-mentioned assumptions, one cannot conclude from the image alone that the black hole is actually rotating.</em></strong>  The interplay of these assumptions is something I&#8217;m still trying to get straight.</p>
<p>Second, if you buy all the assumptions, then the picture I drew in yesterday&#8217;s post is mostly correct except (a) the jets are far too narrow, and shown overly disconnected from the disk, and (b) they are slightly mis-oriented relative to the orientation of the image.  Below is an improved version of this picture, probably still not the final one.  The new features: the jets (now pointing in the right directions relative to the photo) are fatter and not entirely disconnected from the accretion disk.  This is important because the dominant source of illumination of the photon-sphere might come from the region where the disk and jets meet.</p>

It consists of a fat but tenuous accretion disk of material, almost face-on, some of which is funneled into jets, one heading almost toward us, the other in the opposite direction.  The material surrounds but is somewhat separated from a rotating black hole&#8217;s event horizon.  At this radio frequency, the jets <del>and disk</del> are too dim in radio waves to see in the image; <del>only at (and perhaps close to) the photon-sphere</del>, where some of the radio waves are collected and focused, are they bright enough to be easily discerned by the Event Horizon Telescope.</p></div></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The short answer: I&#8217;m really not sure yet. <del> <span style="color:#339966;">[This post is now largely superseded by the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/16/the-black-hole-photo-seeing-more-clearly/">next one</a>, in which some of the questions raised below have now been answered.]</span></del>  <span style="color:#ff0000;">EVEN THAT POST WAS WRONG ABOUT THE PHOTON-SPHERE AND SHADOW.  SEE <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">THIS POST</a> FROM JUNE 2019 FOR SOME ESSENTIAL CORRECTIONS THAT WERE LEFT OUT OF ALL REPORTING ON THIS SUBJECT.</span></p>
<p>Neither are some of my colleagues who know more about the black hole geometry than I do. And at this point we still haven&#8217;t figured out what the Event Horizon Telescope experts do and don&#8217;t know about this question&#8230; or whether they agree amongst themselves.</p>
<p><em>[Note added: last week, a number of people pointed me to a very nice video by Veritasium illustrating some of the features of black holes, accretion disks and the warping of their appearance by the gravity of the black hole.  <strong>However, Veritasium&#8217;s video illustrates a non-rotating black hole with a thin accretion disk that is edge-on from our perspective; and <span style="color:#ff0000;">this is definitely NOT what we are seeing!</span></strong>]</em></p>
<p>As I emphasized in my <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">pre-photo blog post</a> (in which I described carefully what we were likely to be shown, and the subtleties involved), <em><strong>this is not a simple photograph of what&#8217;s `actually there.&#8217;</strong></em> We all agree that what we&#8217;re looking at is light from some glowing material around the solar-system-sized black hole at the heart of the galaxy M87.  But that light has been wildly bent on its path toward Earth, and so &#8212; just like a room seen through an old, warped window, and a dirty one at that &#8212; it&#8217;s not simple to interpret what we&#8217;re actually seeing. Where, exactly, is the material `in truth&#8217;, such that its light appears where it does in the image? Interpretation of the image is potentially ambiguous, and certainly not obvious.<span id="more-10268"></span></p>
<p>The naive guess as to what to <em><strong>expect</strong></em> &#8212; which astronomers developed over many years, based on many studies of many suspected black holes &#8212; is crudely illustrated in the figure at the end of this post.  Material around a black hole has two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>An accretion disk of `gas&#8217; (really <em>plasma</em>, i.e. a very hot collection of electrons, protons, and other atomic nuclei) which may be thin and concentrated, or thick and puffy, or something more complicated.  The disk extends inward to within a few times the radius of the black hole&#8217;s event horizon, the point of no-return; but how close it can be depends on how fast the black hole rotates.</li>
<li>Two oppositely-directed jets of material, created somehow by material from the disk being concentrated and accelerated by magnetic fields tied up with the black hole and its accretion disk; the jets begin not far from the event horizon, but then extend outward all the way to the outer edges of the entire galaxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>But even if this is true, it&#8217;s not at all obvious (at least to me) what these objects look like in an image such as we saw Wednesday. As far as I am currently aware, their appearance in the image depends on</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the disk is thick and puffy, or thin and concentrated;</li>
<li>How far the disk extends inward and outward around the black hole;</li>
<li>The process by which the jets are formed and where exactly they originate;</li>
<li>How fast the black hole is spinning;</li>
<li>The orientation of the axis around which the black hole is spinning;</li>
<li>The typical frequencies of the radio waves emitted by the disk and by the jets (compared to the frequency, about 230 Gigahertz, observed by the Event Horizon Telescope);</li>
</ul>
<p>and perhaps other things. I can&#8217;t yet figure out what we do and don&#8217;t know about these things; and it doesn&#8217;t help that some of the statements made by the EHT scientists in public and in their six papers seem contradictory (and I can&#8217;t yet say whether that&#8217;s because of typos, misstatements by them, or [most likely] misinterpretations by me.)</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the best I can do right now, for myself and for you. Below is a figure that is <em><strong>nothing but an illustration of my best attempt so far to make sense of what we are seeing</strong></em>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><del>You can expect that some fraction of this figure is wrong</del>.</strong></span> <span style="color:#ff0000;">Increasingly I believe this figure is correct in cartoon form, though the picture on the left is too sketchy right now and needs improvement.</span>  <em>[NOTE ADDED: AS EXPLAINED IN <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">THIS MORE RECENT POST</a>, THE &#8220;PHOTON-SPHERE&#8221; DOES NOT EXIST FOR A ROTATING BLACK HOLE; THE &#8220;PHOTON-RING&#8221; OF LIGHT THAT SURROUNDS THE SHADOW DOES NOT DOMINATE WHAT IS ACTUALLY SEEN IN THE IMAGE; AND THE DARK PATCH IN THE IMAGE ISN&#8217;T NECESSARILY THE ENTIRE SHADOW.]</em>  What I&#8217;ll be doing this week is fixing my own misconceptions and trying to become clear on what the experts do and don&#8217;t know. <em>Experts are more than welcome to set me straight!</em></p>
<p>In short &#8212; this story is not over, at least not for me. As I gain a clearer understanding of what we do and don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ll write more about it.</p>

Left: the standard guess concerning the immediate vicinity of M87&#8217;s black hole: an accretion disk oriented nearly face-on from Earth&#8217;s perspective, jets aimed nearly at and away from us, and a rotating black hole at the center.  The orientation of the jets may not be correct relative to the photo.  Upper right: The image after the radio waves&#8217; paths are bent by gravity.  The quasi-silhouette of the black hole is larger than the `true&#8217; event horizon, a lot of radio waves are concentrated at the &#8216;photon-sphere&#8217; just outside (brighter at the bottom due to the black-hole spinning clockwise around an axis slightly askew to our line of sight); some additional radio waves from the accretion disk and jets further complicate the image. Most of the <del>disk</del> and jets are too dim to see.  Lower Right: This image is then blurred out by the Event Horizon Telescope&#8217;s limitations, partly compensated for by heavy-duty image processing.</p></div>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, astronomers Heino Falcke, Fulvio Melia and Eric Agol (a former colleague of mine at the University of Washington) pointed out that the black hole at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, was probably big enough to be observed &#8212; not with a usual camera using visible light, but using radio waves and clever techniques known as &#8220;interferometry&#8221;.  Soon it was pointed out that the black hole in M87, further but larger, could also be observed.  <em>[How? <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">I explained this yesterday in this post.</a>]   </em></p>
<p>And today, an image of the latter, looking quite similar to what we expected, was presented to humanity.  Just as with the discovery of the Higgs boson, and with LIGO&#8217;s first discovery of gravitational waves, nature, captured by the hard work of an international group of many scientists, gives us something definitive, uncontroversial, and spectacularly in line with expectations.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have more to say about this later <em>[have to do non-physics work today <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f626.png" alt="😦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ]</em> and in particular about the frustration of not finding any helpful big surprises during this great decade of fundamental science &#8212; but for now, let&#8217;s just enjoy this incredible image for what it is, and congratulate those who proposed this effort and those who carried it out.</p>
