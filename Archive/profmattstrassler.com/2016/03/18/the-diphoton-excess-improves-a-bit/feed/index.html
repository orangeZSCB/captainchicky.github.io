					<description><![CDATA[G&#039;day Professor Strassler , what is a dimension of space ? How do the three dimensions of space come into being? From whence do they originate? How does one dimension of space become two dimensions working in unison? How does that then become three dimensions of space all working together in complete unison even when travelling at light speed? For light to travel even at the far reaches of the universe it has to have the three dimensions of space to travel into, from whence and via what mechanism does this three dimensional space come into being. Surely for three dimensions of space to come into being, energy is required, so what is this energy ,what are its origins and how does it work? Never mind the possible 10 or 11 dimensions,start with something simple like how do you get 2 or 3 dimensional plains working and moving together.  Are the dimensions of space ( length/ energy ) continuous or discrete and what is the working relationship with light speed and relative motion? How does this effect entropic balance throughout the universe? Now for some light comedy- am I a mug for asking such questions? Kindly respond at your leisure and pleasure. Cheers. Pete. Stiphout .

					<description><![CDATA[G&#039;day Professor Strassler , the dark energy distribution is always smooth  and always remains constant over time and does not dilute as the universe expands. The dark energy density- energy not carried by particles or matter - remains the same. For this reason,physicists refer to this type of energy as a cosmological constant. To quote Professor Susan Randall! This being so I ask ,where does this energy come from? For the dark energy density to remain constant over time and universal expansion can only mean that energy is coming into the universe. That does rather seem to contradict the idea that the amount of energy in the universe is constant ,unchanged since the Big Bang. A universe and even a multi-verse is much more easily explained mathematically via the use of a singular dimension infinite length/energy string . Then constructing a three dimensional universe then add relative motion and expansion . All quite easily done using dual inputs. What I call Duality systems may be similar or same to Transcendence maths systems. On the shape of the universe , the complete lack of observable curvature is highly intriguing and I wonder could that shape be related to the structure of the Higgs Field and might that structure be determined by observation of three different types of Higgs Boson. Thanks to you and Professor Randall just for having beautiful minds and sharing them. Cheers. Pete. Stiphout . Sent from my iPad

					<description><![CDATA[G&#039;day Professor, may I have the new mass/energy numbers for the up and down quark, that you mentioned. As I have developed a system of patterns to describe particles but have no accurate figures for quark m/e. Thanks for your well chosen words on physics, cheers. Pete. S.

					<description><![CDATA[Forgive me for bringing up another topic, nuclear fusion, but these experiments are making me nervous. The sun is a nuclear fusion reactor and stars of a certain mass can create a black hole if and when the collapse.

So, is it possible under the right setup to create a micro black hole in a nuclear fusion experiment?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Kumpikin LHC:n tällaisia signaaleja etsivistä koeryhmistä, ATLAS ja CMS, näkivät samanlaisen vihjeen, mikä tekee siitä luotettavamman. Toisaalta kummankaan ryhmän signaali ei erottunut kohinasta varmasti. Joulukuuhun mennessä koeryhmät eivät olleet vielä ehtineet käydä tarkkaan läpi kaikkea viime vuoden aikana kerättyä dataa huolella. Kahden viime viikon aikana pidetyssä Moriondin konferenssissa ne esittelivät tarkempaa analyysiä. [&#8230;]]]></description>
