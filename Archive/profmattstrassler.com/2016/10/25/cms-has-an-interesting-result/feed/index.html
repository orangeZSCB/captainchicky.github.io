					<description><![CDATA[Dear Prof. Strassler, I wrote to Harvard to try to get in touch with you as I read in New Scientist that you were involved in some Gravitational research with two others I did not receive any response from them and so do not know if you are still there.   I wonder if I could send you a copy of my technical paper as I believe some of my own research results may help to give closure to this work/assist in it&#039;s preparation. I refer to the findings of gravitational variation for variant Higgs-Mass samples taken/measured. I am trying to get my paper published on ArxIv.org, but I need someone to put this forward who has been published on that site. I wonder if you could help me with this to get it published? My work is based on 18 years research and I believe that we have found a new mathematical constant and proof of the fractional Charges of Quarks amongst 18 other things that are being sought in the Physics fields.Please could you email me with your reply rather than on here. Many Thanks. I am very Disabled now having suffered a Bi-Lateral Pulmonary Embolism and a series of Micro-Strokes that has left me with intermittent speech and balance problems. My paper exists as a word document and I can ask my friend Maureen Neathway to send you a copy if this would  be of interest ? I really would like to get this out into the Scientific Community as I believe it may help across a number of fields. Thank you for your very good attention, Yours Sincerely,(Mr).  Garron R. Martin, MAES,AMASA, Engineer.]]></description>

Dear prof. Strassler,
can I please get your email? I want to write you about a 4 years old posting, that I think would interest you.
I am enthusiastic that you returned to blogging, you do a tremendous job at explaining modern physics to people who are not theoretical physicist, but have a good mathematical &#038; physical background (like electrical engineers).
Take care and continue please with your educational contributions to people who like to understand modern physics....]]></description>

Thanks; fixed.  It&#039;s confusing to say &quot;collected&quot; because of course many of them weren&#039;t triggered on.  So I went with &quot;LHC produced ... at CMS&quot; which is clearer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;CMS produced about 600 million Z particles in 2012. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

To be a bit pedantic, CMS is a detector, and does not produce any particles. I believe you meant that CMS collected data on 600 million Z particles.  
I enjoyed the article, and am glad that you are again writing occasionally. You have very clear explanations of particle physics phenomena for general audiences, in my opinion.]]></description>
