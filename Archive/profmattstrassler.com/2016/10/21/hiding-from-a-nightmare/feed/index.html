					<description><![CDATA[Matt:
I am a late-comer to your blog and really appreciate your explanations and updates on the science. I found your blog by looking up an explanation for virtual particles [very good] back in 2012 and have dipped in on various topics coming up to your latest here. It made me think of something you wrote in the blog about virtual particles about the fields. I have pasted it below. Could you explain more about the &#039;metric&#039; of space-time and how some of the fields *could* form part of the metric for dimensions beyond our three dimensions and time.  Or probably much simpler, direct me to articles or books that would explain these theories in more detail?

Thank you. 

&quot;Most fields are best thought of as pervading three-dimensional-space and time, except for the graviton field, also known as the “metric” of space-time (the object that is needed to decide how far part two points are) which is really intrinsic to space-time.

In most theories with extra dimensions, some of the fields that we observe would actually form a part of the metric of the higher-dimensional space time. In other words, one explanation as to why there are so many fields in nature might be that we live in a world that has some of its dimensions wrapped up (think of how a hose has a large dimension along the hose and small dimension around the hose) and that the metric of the full space-time looks to us, in three-dimensional space, like a metric for three-dimensional space and time along with many other fields whose explanation seems non-obvious.&quot;]]></description>

You know, it is a sad comment on the United States that when people learn about hidden valleys they think of salad dressing.  It&#039;s like thinking of The Wiz when asked about Oz, or thinking of a certain stereotype-driven sitcom when asked about the history of the universe.   However, if you prefer to swim in a creamy vinaigrette instead of a cool alpine lake, be my guest.]]></description>

There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of this observation, but the objection you raised is not one of them.  The constraints on BSM Z bosons ***all*** assume that their coupling constants are close to those of the Standard Model, and are thus greater than 0.1.  A BSM Z boson with coupling constant much below 0.001 is simply not constrained at all at most masses above 10 MeV or so, and above 10 GeV any boson with a coupling below 0.01 is allowed; above the Z mass it is even worse.  Hidden valleys often have fundamental or composite bosons with couplings to Standard Model fields that are much less than 0.1 .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Highly skeptical of any signal of a relatively low energy particle that shows up as a bump in one old study and has not been revealed in any subsequent experiments in any notable way. A look elsewhere effect limited the LEP doesn&#039;t take into account the fact that there have been other experiments conducted since then, and that a failure to find it them greatly lowers the significance of the result if it doesn&#039;t rule it out entirely. For example, the constraint on possible BSM Z boson decays is very tight.]]></description>

It is no more promising than the diphoton bump.  It is a bit less, in fact.  However, when the Higgs first appeared in December 2011, it was also, in my opinion, not very promising.  Most small bumps go away.  All big bumps that stick around start as small bumps.  Deal with it.]]></description>
