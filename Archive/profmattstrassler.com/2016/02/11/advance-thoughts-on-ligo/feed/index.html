					<description><![CDATA[A new physical theory with STW ( Static Time Waves)
In the beginning was infinite geometric space. This space became filled with Static Time at absolute rest and absolute cold. Static time is strictly quantitative, and does not differentiate between past, present and future. Being quantifiable and measurable, static time is a scientific concept. Static time of 0.0033 microseconds per meter will be measured regardless of the direction chosen.
Stars move through static time, which does not disrupt their motion. Static time exists but is imperceptible. Static time is the deepest secret of the universe. 
Static time fills all infinite space, eliminating the possibility of a vacuum.  Static Time Waves (STW) travel through static time. The speed of STW is 300,000 km/second.
Aetzbar in amazon   
The Newtonian universe is based on matter and force.
The Einsteinian universe is based on matter and energy.
The Aetzbarian universe is based on static time and energy.
There is no gravity, and there is no gravity waves.
There is  Static Time , and there is Static Time Waves. (STW)
There is a particles of Static Time.
Static Time is real and measured.
Everyone knows the Dynamic Time.
It is time to recognize the Static Time.

Gravitational interaction of antimatter ? : Neutrino oscillations induced by a flavor-dependent violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle have been considered as a suitable explanation of the solar electron-neutrino deficiency.
Neutrinos can undergo flavor--oscillations if they possess flavor--dependent couplings to the surrounding gravitational field. ?]]></description>

GW is not energy and momentum, it is highenergy photons (+ cosmological constant) entangled with photons traveling at c (discreteness) - could be quantized. 
If it is more than &quot;c&quot; (consciousness) - could not be quantized - and causes energy&#038;momentum along Geodesic - we observe as lagrangian.
 
If the Gravitational waves from the Big Bang travels slightly more than the light speed - it could reach us unlike big bang light - which could not overcome the space expansion (by dark energy) - which causes the darkness of the sky - and discreteness in light, called the photons. 
We now measure the slight tremours of upcoming bigbang waves - before that we see a blue light (cherenkov effect).]]></description>

Continuing about what knew: then,thats only detects momentary events like explosions, large masses passages, etc. and nothing stable, that for example, that if black holes merges remain in progress for a long time, the disturbance of these laser would start, but the disturbance that would start, will be as stable system at same time pursuing the merger of these black holes, then,  a new fact perturb, but if it continues, it adds to the Earth-Moon-Sun system and should be abandoned again as disturbance to be incorporated into the balance. This does not help at all to accept the existence of particles such as gravitons, but only to be accept the existence of masses that create gravitational fields and that are creating it by that waves. That is, all facys of relativity (deformation of space and nothing else) and no facts by particle physics. Is It? That is my question. thanks]]></description>

I knews from other sources that the gravitational waves coming from Earth, are relevant and detectable, as well as the earth-moon system and earth-sun too. What happens is that as seismic disturbances and other external factors, are all annulled, should be canceled, due to the laser system stability. Just when constructed the detector system, that stability is not taken into account or to detects, that impossible to detect because after assembled all this, there are no further disturbance / imbalance to detect. So would remain to be another new disorder to detect, and then, even vanishingly lower effects than from earth systems. And it will be a &quot;new&quot; or disturbance-imbalance that lasers detects. At least that&#039;s what I knows from another source.]]></description>

/Physicists like Rayleigh, Jeans, and Lorentz set Planck&#039;s constant to zero in order to align with classical physics, but Planck knew well that this constant had a precise nonzero value. &quot;I am unable to understand Jeans&#039; stubbornness – he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as Hegel was for Realism philosophy (localization)/. 

A wasp does not drown on water. We evolved with knocking of molecules around us - and gravity - what we call momentum. 
A wave in our decoherence must have a flip - above momentum is the flip - or consciousness ?]]></description>

By localizing the relativity (as point parricle), like in quantum decoherence and in ultraviolet catastrophe, - the superposition Energy (Cosmological cobstant) is not accounted - because the dark eneegy has no Momentum like the light quanta (mass energy or zero mass momentum) ?]]></description>

To fit the common sense of mass Higgs mechanism was introduced. To fit the common sense of gravity Geneeal relativity was introduced. 
But it was localized (euler-lagragian) by point &quot;particle&quot; or light quanta. ?
 
Einstein&#039;s equations as we have derived them are indeed the correct field equations for the metric, let&#039;s see how they can be derived from a more modern viewpoint, starting from an action principle. (In fact the equations were first derived by Hilbert, not Einstein, and Hilbert did it using the action principle. But he had been inspired by Einstein&#039;s previous papers on the subject, and Einstein himself derived the equations independently, so they are rightly named after Einstein. The action, however, is rightly called the Hilbert action.) The action should be the integral over spacetime of a Lagrange density (&quot;Lagrangian&quot; for short, although strictly speaking the Lagrangian is the integral over space of the Lagrange density.]]></description>
