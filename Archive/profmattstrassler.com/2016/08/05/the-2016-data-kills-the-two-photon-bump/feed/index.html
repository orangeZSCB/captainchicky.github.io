					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/08/05/the-2016-data-kills-the-two-photon-bump/#comment-348133&quot;&gt;jonW&lt;/a&gt;.

The latter, I&#039;d say. These are two different problems with a somewhat similar flavour. Physicists do not usually use the phrase &quot;&lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; naturalness problem&quot; (at least not without context), but rather call them the &quot;hierarchy problem&quot; (the one about the Higgs mass) and the &quot;cosmological constant problem&quot; (the one about the zero-point energy of the vacuum), respectively.

Both are related to the fact that quantum field theory predicts that quantum fluctuations affect the values of observable quantities like particle masses or the vacuum energy (observable by tracing the rate of expansion of the universe).

There are quantum fluctuations at every length scale (e.g. 1 cm, 0.1 cm, 0.01 cm, 0.001 cm, etc.) and they all contribute, as long as the theory is to be trusted. So you need to accumulate the effects over the range of length scales over which you expect the theory to hold, and usually the shortest length scales (highest energy scales) have the largest effects. Thus one expects the observable properties to be proportional or otherwise naturally related to the highest energy scales where the theory holds -- &lt;i&gt;unless there is a very good reason that a certain observable is not affected by the quantum fluctuations&lt;/i&gt;.

For example, if physics is supersymmetric within a certain range of length scales, the quantum fluctuations at those length scales will in total not affect the Higgs mass. Only the length scales were supersymmetry does not hold (and we know it does not hold at very long length scales, i.e. at low energies) would contribute. So supersymmetry could solve or at least greatly mitigate the hierarchy problem, if it holds at very high energies and &quot;reaches down far enough to lower energies&quot;. Unfortunately, it currently seems that supersymmetry, if it is there, does not reach down far enough to be detectable at the LHC.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, could you clear something up for me? I remember (though perhaps misremember) from your writings that the naturalness problem was that empty space had energy in a miniscule (but non-zero) amount--we would have expected the quite large positive and negative contributions to the energy of empty space to result in a much greater absolute value. But from reading Natalie Wolchover&#039;s article at Quanta today (&quot;What No New Particles Means for Physics&quot;), it appears that according to her, the naturalness problem is that the Higgs has the low mass it does. Wolchover writes that the various large contributions, positive and negative, to the Higgs&#039;s mass, would be expected to add up to something much more energetic, and the coincidence that they almost perfectly cancel each other out requires explanation. My question is: are these two obviously similar accounts just different descriptions of the same underlying difficulty with reconciling theory and observation? Or are they two independent issues whose descriptions happen to be somewhat parallel? And, if they are independent coincidences, are both of these indeed known (confusingly) as &quot;the naturalness problem&quot;, or are they two specific instances of a more general category of &quot;naturalness problem&quot;, which includes these two as well as possibly other instances of calculations that proceed along similar lines?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, your comparison to the Higgs in 2011 is misguided. The reason it was appropriate to have some serious confidence that what was seen in 2011 was real and was the Higgs was that the Higgs almost certainly had to exist. We knew that by far the only reasonable things that could fix the problem of WW scattering unitarity violation was the Higgs or technicolor. By 2011, technicolor was extremely constrained and highly unlikely to be the correct model. That left the Higgs as by far the most likely thing to exist, and 1000 times more likely to exist than nothing at all which would ruin quantum mechanics. 

So to compare that to this 750 GeV bump is really comparing apples and oranges. There is absolutely no prior reason why there should be some random new scalar particle at that mass scale. It fixes nothing in the Standard Model, it is not the dark matter, it is totally random. That doesn&#039;t mean that a priori it couldn&#039;t have been real, but it required much more evidence for it to be taken seriously.

The evidence required for a new particle beyond SM needed to be extraordinary for this extraordinary claim. While the Higgs, being part of the SM, only needed ordinary evidence for it was only an ordinary claim of the null hypothesis.]]></description>
