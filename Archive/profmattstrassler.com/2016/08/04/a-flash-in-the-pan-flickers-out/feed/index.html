That and the pentaquark... and a whole family of tetraquarks. Just formerly hypothetical particles now confirmed to exist, enhancing our understanding of the strong force. And I&#039;m sure there&#039;s nothing else interesting in the 50 or times more data the LHC has to collect. Truly its best days are behind it.]]></description>

Body language.  Lack of smiles.  Scheduling the talks in an obscure parallel session with nothing planned at CERN.  It was clear there was no discovery; the only thing that wasn&#039;t known was whether there was evidence *against*.  (Of course, I could always change my title and presentation at the last minute, so there was no cost to choosing the one I did.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, must we conclude you had some advance warning that the bump disappeared, from the fact you already have a talk planned whose title reflects the let-down? [Please don&#039;t read that as accusatory or snarky, I&#039;m really curious]]]></description>

&#062;&quot;But how do you convince young researchers to choose particle physics with such a result?&quot;

It&#039;s not an unexpected result. It&#039;s really pretty typical. The hype machine got a bit carried away, the media oversold it as always, but I doubt many of the paper-writing theorists are truly shattered by the negative result. It was always a long shot, but it was a long shot on the biggest game in town. I&#039;ll also point out that the LHC did find a pentaquark not so long ago too!

There are plenty of interesting areas in particle physics. Just this week I read about several related experiments suggesting an anomaly between the oscillation of neutrinos compared to that of antineutrinos.

So don&#039;t be down! Particle physics is still a rich vein.]]></description>
