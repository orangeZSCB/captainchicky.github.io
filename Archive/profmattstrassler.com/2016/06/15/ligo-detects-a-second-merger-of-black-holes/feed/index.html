The force carrier might be the graviton. However we don&#039;t know enough about how gravity works to be sure it requires a particle-based explanation. In relativity the waves are just waves in spacetime and avoid particles entirely.]]></description>

I&#039;m glad it helped. I cannot offer a more detailed explanation, as I&#039;m still weak in general relativity. The localization of energy in the gravitational field is a confusing topic, and it is so even to physicists. So confusing, in deed, that there were long debates among physicists about whether gravitational waves actually can transport energy.

Feynman finally ended this debate in his characteristic manner by proposing a (thought) experiment with two sticky beads on a stick (google &quot;Sticky bead argument&quot;). The argument clearly showed that a gravitational wave would make the beads oscillate and rub against the stick, passing energy to it. In a way LIGO is an insanely advanced high-tech realization of Feynman&#039;s sticky bead antenna. -- Of course, it uses laser interference instead of friction to detect the wave.]]></description>

That actually makes a lot of sense to me, and you are exactly right: I&#039;m imagining a sharp demarcation of the mass-energy of the black hole at the horizon, when in fact that&#039;s not really so. Ergo, there&#039;s no paradox. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Gravity is important for keeping the universe out of thermal equilibrium. Gravitationally bound systems have negative specific heat - decrease of entropy or blackhole evoporation, through Stokes Raman scattering ?
—that is, the velocities of their components increase when energy is removed - variation of entropy at shear - or involution ? 

So Higgs field is not Tachyonic at critical temperature - but Diffeomorphic (isomorphic) ??]]></description>

I do not think the question is dumb. I rather think it is based on a somewhat oversimplified view of black holes as &quot;containers of energy&quot;. As far as I know there is no way to exactly localize the energy stored in a gravitational field like for example that of a black hole. You cannot pinpoint where a certain amount of energy &quot;actually is&quot; at a given moment. So in particular one cannot make the statement that all the energy is behind the event horizon. Therefore there is also no contradiction in the energy being radiated from the merger. Also the precise location of the event horizon during a merger is a complicated question. The event horizon is not a surface that can be defined in an instant. It is rather defined by looking at the whole history (including the merger in this case) &quot;backwards&quot; from the far future. (I think &quot;event horizon&quot; is actually one of the rare cases where physicists actually picked a good name for something. ;) Like the horizon in normal language use it is something that is only well-defined for an observer who is looking from far away. If you actually would &quot;walk to the horizon&quot;, you would not find any special &quot;horizon line&quot; there.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the nice post. Always great to see your informative expository work.

I have what I am sure is a dumb question, but what the heck: As you note 14 and 8 solar mass black holes merged to form a 21 solar mass black hole, converting the remainder to energy in the form of gravitational waves. This looks superficially like the original black holes &quot;lost mass&quot; through the process of merging, which would be impossible (at this rate, at least) in other circumstances. How does the merger process allow all that mass to &quot;get out&quot;? It doesn&#039;t appear that some binding energy of the binary system is what&#039;s being converted to gravitational wave energy; it&#039;s the mass of the two original black holes themselves. This seems to be contradictory to the notion that nothing can get out of a black hole except via the incredibly slow process of Hawking radiation.

Thanks for your time!]]></description>
