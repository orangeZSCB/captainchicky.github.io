        <h2>What is a zip bomb?</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, let's start with the definitions.<br>
        <br>
        <span>A <b>zip bomb</b> is a <i>usually</i> malicious compressed file that is usually designed to render useless an antivirus engine to create an openning for another computer virus.</span>
        <p>Normally, a zip bomb negates an antivirus engine by tricking it into scanning the entire archive, which takes up an unimaginably large amount of time, disk space, and memory. However, modern antivirus engines are able to recongnize when a file is a zip bomb, and will avoid scanning through it.</p>
        <p>Despite this, what I'm looking at isn't its ability to destroy antivirus engines or create openning for other viruses to attack - instead, let's take a look into the marvelous compression ability of zip bombs, and the science behind it.</p>
        <p>When talking about zip bombs, I will split them into two catagories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Traditional zip bombs.</b></li>
            <li><b>The "better" zip bombs.</b></li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have have heard of another type of "zip bomb": the <b>zip quine</b>. However, I would like for you to note that this is an entirely different thing compared to a zip bomb. While it <i>can</i> be used in theory to disable antivirus engines &c like how zip bombs do, they are <i>much more sophisticated</i> compared to zip bombs and deserves its own article that I will write sometime in the future.</p>
        <p>That leaves us with the two types of zip bombs, the traditional and the better ones. So without further ado, let's take a look at them.</p>
        <h2>Traditional zip bombs</h2>
