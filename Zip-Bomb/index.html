        <h2>What is a zip bomb?</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, let's start with the definitions.<br>
        <br>
        <span>A <b>zip bomb</b> is a <i>usually</i> malicious compressed file that is usually designed to render useless an antivirus engine to create an openning for another computer virus.</span>
        <p>Traditionally, a zip bomb negates an antivirus engine by tricking it into scanning the entire archive, which takes up an unimaginably large amount of time, disk space, and memory. However, modern antivirus engines are able to recongnize when a file is a zip bomb, and will avoid scanning through it.</p>
