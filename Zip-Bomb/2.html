    This is my attempt at recreating a <b>zip bomb</b> - a small compressed file that seemingly holds an unimaginably large amount of data inside.
    <br>
    This time though, instead of using traditional zip compression algorithms, I use 7zip the handful of compmression algorithms it already has to nest each loop of zips.
    <br>
    The original infamous zip bomb, 42.zip that inspired me into looking into zip bombs and consequently making this can be found <a href=./42.html>here</a>.

    More information can be found on my zip bomb <a href=./index.html>homepage</a>.
