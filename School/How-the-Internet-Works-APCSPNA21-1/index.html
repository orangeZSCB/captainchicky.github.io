        The Internet is a vast and complicated network of different computing devices that connects billions of devices together. Without the Internet, the moden world as we know of would almost come to a complete stop. However, such a vital element of every person's everyday life is not completely understood. This webpage will introduce basic concepts of the Internet for its readers to get a general idea of what it is, and how it works.

      <h2>IP addresses</h2>
      <p>
        An Internet Protocol address, also known as an IP address is the an ID that a computer connected to a network via the <a href="#IP">Internet Protocol</a> uses to communicate with other computers in the network. The IP addess serves not only as an identification, but can also serve as a redirection to a <a href="#DNS">domain</a>, and a host.
        <br><br>
        There are two main types of IP addresses, which are</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)</li>
          <li>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        In IPv4, each IP address is defined to be a 32-bit number, such as "127.0.0.1". This means that there would be a total of 2<sup>32</sup> = 4,294,967,296 different IPv4 addresses availible. However, due to the explosive growth of the internet, the number of IPv4 addresses is depleting rather fast, which meant another form of IP address was needed. <br><br>
        As a result, the IPv6 was introduced. An IPv6 address is defined to be a 128-bit string of not neccesarily numbers, such as "3010:cb9:0:1425:581:6:2". This means there are a total of 2<sup>128</sup> = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 different IPv6 addresses availible. The IPv6 was standardized in 1998, and has been undergoing deployment ever since. <br><br>
        IP addresses are assigned by a central authority called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which distributes IP addresses to reginal Internet registeries, which then distribute the IP addresses to Internet Service Providers and other local users who need the IPs. Netadmins such as an Internet Service Provider can assign dynamic or static IP addresses, which change or remain the same over time.

      <h2 id="Fault-Tolerance" >Fault Tolerance</h2>
      <p>Fault Tolerance is the ability for computers and other devices which uses the internet, to not completely shut down. This is important because a computer is not expected to be perfect and it will have some errors in it so the fault tolerance can prevent extensive damage.</p>

      <h2   id="DNS">Domain Name Systems, Subdomains, and Hiearchy</h2>
      <p>The Domain Name System is a system which maps names into the Internet's protocol for computers and other devices which use the internet. When a device asks for a website or something of the sort, it asks the domain name system which in turn asks other domain name systems. Then the information for the website is transported into the computer and the computer is able to committed this into memory. 
      <br><br>
      The Subdomain is exactly as it sounds. It is an extra part of the domain name. It can separate domain names into sizes that suit the names the best.
      <br><br>
      Hiearchy in computer science is a structure which ranks items in level of importance. The computer ranks it's items in response times</p>

      <br>
      <h2 id="Latency" >Latency</h2>
      <p> Latency is the time it takes for data to move between the source and the client(user). Latency is measured in milliseconds. A lower latency is better becasue it usally means that the loading times is faster. Some causes of a high latency could be that the  <a href="#Bandwidth/Bit-rate"> bandwidth or bit-rate</a> is low. </p>

      <h2 id="Packets" >Data Streams and Packets</h2>
      <p>
        Packets are used in the Internet to transport data. Information and data are broken down into a multidue of packets. These packets are an easier means of transportantion through the Internet. Packets contain information of where they were sent from and where they are going to. Packets are sent through the Internet using routers. The routers chose the destination of packets based on how busy, conjested, or expenive paths to a packet's destination are. 
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <h2 id="Routers">Routers</h2>
      <p>
        Routers are computers that distriubte information accross a network. These computers are used to forward packets to their intended destination.

      <br>
      <h2 id="Network Reduncancy">Network Redundancy</h2>
      <p>
        Network redundancy is used to make networks fault tolerant. Multiple routers or key computers are used to make sure a network doesn't go down if a single router or computer is attacked or malfunctions.
